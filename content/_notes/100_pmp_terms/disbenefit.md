A **Disbenefit** is a **measurable result from an outcome that is perceived as negative** by one or more stakeholders. **Like benefits, disbenefits should be identified, categorized, quantified, and measured** using structured benefits management techniques.

## **Key Aspects of Disbenefits**
- **Negative Impact on Stakeholders** – Some project outcomes may have unintended drawbacks.
- **Quantifiable & Measurable** – Can be tracked like benefits but represent undesirable effects.
- **Requires Active Management** – Should be minimized or mitigated through risk planning.
- **Part of Benefits Realization Analysis** – Helps in making informed project decisions.

## **Examples of Disbenefits**
| **Scenario** | **Disbenefit** |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Software Upgrade** | Increased learning curve and temporary productivity loss. |
| **Office Relocation** | Longer commute times for some employees. |
| **Automation Implementation** | Job displacement for certain roles. |
| **Process Standardization** | Reduced flexibility in how work is performed. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Corporate Restructuring**
A company restructuring to **reduce operational costs** may experience **lower employee morale and resistance to change** as a disbenefit.

### **Technology Implementation**
A **new enterprise software system** improves efficiency but **requires months of training**, causing a temporary dip in productivity.

### **Public Infrastructure Project**
A city constructs **a new highway**, reducing travel time but **increasing noise pollution for nearby residents**.

## **Why Managing Disbenefits Matters**
- **Improves Stakeholder Satisfaction** – Helps address concerns proactively.
- **Balances Decision-Making** – Ensures negative impacts are considered alongside benefits.
- **Supports Risk Management** – Enables planning for unintended consequences.
- **Enhances Project Transparency** – Provides a full view of project outcomes.
