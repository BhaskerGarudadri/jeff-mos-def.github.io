## **Issue**
An **issue** is a **current condition or situation that may impact one or more project objectives**. Unlike risks, which are **potential future events**, issues are **problems that have already occurred** and require resolution.

### **Key Aspects of an Issue**

- **Requires Immediate Attention** – Needs mitigation or resolution.
- **May Affect Scope, Budget, or Schedule** – Can cause delays or cost overruns.
- **Tracked in an Issue Log** – Helps teams document and manage resolution efforts.

### **Common Types of Issues**

| **Technical Issues**  | Software bugs, infrastructure failures, system downtime. |
| **Resource Issues**   | Lack of staffing, skill shortages, equipment unavailability. |
| **Stakeholder Issues** | Conflicting priorities, misaligned expectations, lack of engagement. |
| **Scope Issues**      | Unapproved scope changes, unclear requirements, miscommunication. |
