**Change Control** is a **formal process** used to **identify, document, approve, or reject modifications** to project documents, deliverables, or baselines. It ensures that changes are evaluated for **impact, feasibility, and alignment** with project objectives before implementation.

## Key Aspects of Change Control
- **Manages Project Modifications** – Ensures changes are assessed and controlled.
- **Requires Formal Documentation** – Changes must be recorded and approved.
- **Evaluates Impact** – Considers cost, schedule, and scope implications.
- **Prevents Uncontrolled Scope Creep** – Avoids unnecessary or unauthorized changes.

## Change Control Process
1. **Change Identification** – A request for modification is submitted.
2. **Impact Analysis** – The change is assessed for feasibility and risks.
3. **Approval or Rejection** – A decision is made by the **Change Control Board (CCB)**.
4. **Implementation Planning** – If approved, an action plan is created.
5. **Documentation & Communication** – The change is recorded, and stakeholders are informed.
6. **Execution & Monitoring** – The change is applied, and its impact is monitored.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
- A team submits a change request to **extend a project timeline** due to additional feature requirements.

### **Construction Project**
- A contractor requests a **material substitution** due to supply chain disruptions, requiring approval from the project owner.

### **Business Operations**
- A financial services firm **updates compliance policies**, triggering a review of operational procedures.

## Why Change Control Matters
- **Ensures Project Stability** – Keeps project scope and resources aligned.
- **Improves Decision-Making** – Evaluates the risks and benefits of changes.
- **Enhances Stakeholder Communication** – Provides transparency in modifications.
- **Supports Governance & Compliance** – Maintains structured control over project changes.
