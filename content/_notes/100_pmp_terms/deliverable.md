- **Can Be Internal or External** – May be used within the team or delivered to a customer.
- **Exists at Different Levels** – Found at project, phase, or task levels.
- **Aligned with Project Objectives** – Supports overall business or stakeholder goals.

| **Process Deliverables** | Documents or outputs that support project execution. | A project plan, risk register, or test report. |
| **Service Deliverables** | A completed service or capability provided. | A software deployment, consulting service, or training session. |

## **Example Scenarios**
