A **Story Map** is a visual model of all the features and functionality desired for a given product, created to give the team a holistic view of what they are building and why.

It organizes user stories based on workflows or activities, allowing teams to prioritize functionality, identify dependencies, and plan releases in a structured, user-centered format.

## Key Characteristics

- **Top-Down Structure** – Starts with user activities, then breaks down into features and stories  
- **User-Centric** – Built around real user needs and goals  
- **Supports Release Planning** – Helps slice the product into meaningful increments  
- **Improves Shared Understanding** – Visualizes the full scope of the product in context  

## Example Scenarios

- Mapping an e-commerce experience from product search to checkout  
- Prioritizing stories for an MVP based on critical user journeys  
- Planning upcoming sprints by release slices drawn from the map
