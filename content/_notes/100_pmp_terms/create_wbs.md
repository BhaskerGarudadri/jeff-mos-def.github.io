## Process: Create WBS

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Scope Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Create WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)** process involves **decomposing the project scope into smaller, more manageable components** called work packages. The WBS provides a **hierarchical structure** that defines all the work required to complete the project, forming the foundation for planning, estimating, scheduling, and controlling.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the scope management plan that outlines how the WBS will be developed and maintained.
- **Project Documents** – Includes the project scope statement and requirements documentation.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Standards, tools, or organizational expectations for structuring scope.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – WBS templates, historical information, and lessons learned from similar projects.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to structure the WBS based on experience with similar projects.
- **Decomposition** – The primary technique for breaking down deliverables into smaller, more manageable components.
- **Team Collaboration** – Involving stakeholders and team members to ensure the breakdown is complete and practical.

---

## Outputs

- **Scope Baseline**, which includes:
  - **Project Scope Statement** – Final version after decomposition.
  - **WBS** – A hierarchical structure of the entire scope.
  - **WBS Dictionary** – A detailed description of each work package including deliverables, assumptions, and acceptance criteria.

- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to requirements documentation, assumption log, or lessons learned register as needed.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- In the **Planning Process Group**, Create WBS translates scope into tangible work elements.
- Within **Project Scope Management**, it creates the structure that supports detailed planning, performance measurement, and control.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Improves Clarity and Control** – Breaks down complex scope into manageable pieces.
- **Supports Estimating and Scheduling** – Enables more accurate planning by isolating work packages.
- **Enhances Accountability** – Assigns ownership at the work package level.
- **Enables Progress Tracking** – Provides structure for monitoring completion and performance.
