The **Fixed Formula Method** is a **way of estimating earned value (EV)** by assigning a **specified percentage of a work package’s budget** to the **start milestone** and the **remaining percentage upon completion**. This method provides a **simplified way to track progress**, ensuring that **value is only recognized at key milestones**.

## **Key Aspects of the Fixed Formula Method**
- **Pre-Defined Percentage Allocations** – A fixed portion of the work package budget is recognized at the start, with the rest assigned upon completion.
- **Used for Earned Value Measurement (EVM)** – Helps track progress in a structured way.
- **Prevents Overstatement of Progress** – Ensures EV isn’t earned prematurely.
- **Best for Short, Well-Defined Work Packages** – Works well in environments where progress is milestone-based.

## **Common Fixed Formula Percentages**
| **Fixed Formula Split** | **Description** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **50/50 Rule** | 50% of the budgeted value is earned at the start, and 50% at completion. |
| **25/75 Rule** | 25% is earned at the start, and 75% upon completion. |
| **0/100 Rule** | No value is earned until the task is fully completed. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A **code module work package** is estimated at **\$10,000**:
- Using the **50/50 Rule**, **\$5,000** is earned when work begins, and **\$5,000** is earned at completion.

### **Construction Project**
A **structural framework installation** follows the **25/75 Rule**:
- **25% of budget is recognized at work start**.
- **75% is earned when all framework work is complete**.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A **digital ad campaign setup** follows the **0/100 Rule**:
- **No value is assigned until the full ad campaign is live**.

## **Why Fixed Formula Method Matters**
- **Simplifies Earned Value Tracking** – Reduces complexity in measuring progress.
- **Prevents Overestimated Completion Percentages** – Ensures progress is only counted at key milestones.
- **Improves Financial Forecasting** – Provides clear performance insights.
- **Best for Work with Clear Milestones** – Suitable for projects with defined start and finish phases.
