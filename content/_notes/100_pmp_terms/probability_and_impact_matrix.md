# Probability and Impact Matrix

A **Probability and Impact Matrix** is a **grid-based tool** used to evaluate and prioritize project risks by **mapping the likelihood** of each risk’s occurrence against the **severity of its potential impact** on project objectives. This matrix supports qualitative risk analysis and helps guide risk response strategies.

The goal is to distinguish between low, moderate, and high-priority risks, so resources can be focused effectively.

## Key Characteristics

- **Two-Dimensional Grid** – Crosses probability with impact levels  
- **Visual Prioritization** – Highlights high-risk areas in need of immediate attention  
- **Qualitative Tool** – Often used before detailed quantitative analysis  
- **Supports Response Planning** – Informs mitigation, avoidance, or acceptance decisions

## Example Scenarios

- A high-probability, high-impact risk is escalated to leadership for immediate mitigation  
- A low-probability, low-impact risk is accepted and logged for monitoring  
- A moderate-impact, high-probability risk is assigned a contingency plan

## Mockup: Probability and Impact Matrix (Example)

| **Impact ↓ / Probability →** | Low       | Medium    | High      |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **High**                    | Moderate  | High      | Extreme   |
| **Medium**                  | Low       | Moderate  | High      |
| **Low**                     | Low       | Low       | Moderate  |

- **Low** = Minimal attention required  
- **Moderate** = Monitor or plan response  
- **High** = Requires mitigation or escalation  
- **Extreme** = Immediate action and executive attention

## Why Probability and Impact Matrix Matters

- **Enables Risk Prioritization** – Helps identify which risks need active management  
- **Improves Visibility** – Provides a visual reference for risk severity  
- **Supports Better Planning** – Ensures proportional response based on risk level  
- **Informs Stakeholders** – Aids in communicating risk exposure and strategy
