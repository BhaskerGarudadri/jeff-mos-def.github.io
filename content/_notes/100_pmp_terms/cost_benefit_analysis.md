**Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** is a **financial analysis method** used to **compare the benefits of a project against its costs**. It helps organizations determine whether an investment is **financially viable** and supports **informed decision-making**.

## Key Aspects of Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Compares Costs & Benefits** – Evaluates whether expected returns outweigh project expenses.
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Helps determine whether to proceed, modify, or cancel a project.
- **Uses Quantitative & Qualitative Measures** – Includes both financial and non-financial factors.
- **Calculates Return on Investment (ROI)** – Assesses project profitability.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis Formula
$$
\text{Net Benefit} = \text{Total Expected Benefits} - \text{Total Expected Costs}
$$

or

$$
\text{Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)} = \frac{\text{Total Expected Benefits}}{\text{Total Expected Costs}}
$$

- **If BCR > 1** → Project is financially beneficial.
- **If BCR < 1** → Project costs outweigh the benefits.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A company conducts a **Cost-Benefit Analysis** before **developing a new mobile app**, estimating **development costs at \$500,000** and **projected revenue of \$1.5 million**.

### **Construction Project**
A city evaluates whether **building a new highway** is justified by **reducing commute times and increasing economic activity**.

### **Business Expansion**
A retail chain analyzes the **costs of opening a new store** versus the **expected increase in sales and market share**.

## Why Cost-Benefit Analysis Matters
- **Justifies Investments** – Ensures financial and strategic alignment.
- **Reduces Financial Risk** – Prevents costly decisions with low return potential.
- **Enhances Resource Allocation** – Directs funds toward high-value projects.
- **Improves Stakeholder Confidence** – Provides data-driven financial insights.
