**Risk Acceptance** is a risk response strategy that involves acknowledging the risk and taking no action unless it occurs. Acceptance of the risk’s implication(s) usually means using schedule and/or cost reserves and accepting scope and/or quality reduction(s).

It is applied when a risk is deemed tolerable, unavoidable, or not cost-effective to address through other strategies, and it requires monitoring and readiness to respond if the risk materializes.

## Key Characteristics

- **Passive or Active** – May involve no action or preparation of reserves and fallback plans  
- **Cost-Conscious** – Chosen when response costs outweigh potential impact  
- **Tolerance-Based** – Depends on organizational or stakeholder risk appetite  
- **Does Not Reduce Probability** – Focuses on response readiness, not prevention  

## Example Scenarios

- Choosing not to insure against minor equipment damage due to low replacement cost  
- Accepting schedule slippage risk for a low-impact task with ample float  
- Maintaining contingency reserves in case of vendor delivery delays  

## Role in Risk Management

- **Enables Prioritization** – Frees focus for higher-impact risks  
- **Supports Reserve Planning** – Ties directly to use of contingency or management reserves  
- **Allows Flexibility** – Suitable for low-likelihood or low-impact risks  
- **Requires Monitoring** – Tracked as part of ongoing risk review processes
