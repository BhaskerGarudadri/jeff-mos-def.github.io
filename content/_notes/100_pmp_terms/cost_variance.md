**Cost Variance (CV)** measures the **budget deficit or surplus** at a given point in time by calculating the difference between **Earned Value (EV)** and **Actual Cost (AC)**. It is a key metric in **Earned Value Management (EVM)** for tracking project financial performance.

## **Cost Variance Formula**
$$
CV = EV - AC
$$
Where:
- **EV (Earned Value):** The budgeted cost of completed work.
- **AC (Actual Cost):** The actual cost incurred for completed work.

## **Interpreting Cost Variance**
| **CV Value**  | **Meaning** |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **CV > 0**   | Under budget (spending less than planned). |
| **CV = 0**   | On budget (costs align with planned values). |
| **CV < 0**   | Over budget (costs exceed planned values). |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A project has an **EV of \$150,000** and an **AC of \$140,000**:
$$
CV = 150,000 - 140,000 = 10,000
$$
**Interpretation:** The project is **\$10,000 under budget**.

### **Construction Project**
A bridge project has an **EV of \$500,000** and an **AC of \$550,000**:
$$
CV = 500,000 - 550,000 = -50,000
$$
**Interpretation:** The project is **\$50,000 over budget**, requiring cost control measures.

### **Manufacturing**
A production line has an **EV of \$1,000,000** and an **AC of \$1,000,000**:
$$
CV = 1,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0
$$
**Interpretation:** The project is **on budget**.

## **Why Cost Variance Matters**
- **Tracks Project Cost Performance** – Identifies if spending aligns with budget expectations.
- **Supports Financial Forecasting** – Helps predict future cost trends.
- **Enables Proactive Budget Adjustments** – Allows corrective action before overruns become critical.
- **Enhances Stakeholder Confidence** – Demonstrates financial control and accountability.
