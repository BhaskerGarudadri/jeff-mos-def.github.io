## Overview: Project Schedule Management

**Project Schedule Management** involves the processes required to **plan, develop, manage, and control the timely completion** of the project. It ensures that all work is scheduled logically, accurately estimated, and tracked throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Purpose

The goal of Schedule Management is to:

- Define and sequence project activities  
- Estimate durations and allocate resources  
- Develop a realistic, achievable project timeline  
- Monitor progress and control changes to the schedule  

This knowledge area supports **predictability, accountability, and coordination** by structuring when work happens and how progress is tracked.

---

## Key Characteristics

- Time-bound and milestone-driven  
- Closely linked to resource and cost planning  
- Requires logical relationships and dependencies  
- Uses baselines for tracking and forecasting

## Core Processes in Project Schedule Management

| Process | Process Group | Purpose |
|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| **Plan Schedule Management** | Planning | Establishes policies and documentation for planning and controlling the schedule. |
| **Define Activities** | Planning | Breaks down work packages into individual, actionable tasks. |
| **Sequence Activities** | Planning | Determines logical order and dependencies between tasks. |
| **Estimate Activity Durations** | Planning | Approximates the time required for each activity. |
| **Develop Schedule** | Planning | Creates the final project timeline based on all inputs. |
| **Control Schedule** | Monitoring and Controlling | Tracks progress and manages schedule deviations.

## Why Project Schedule Management Matters

- **Improves Time Predictability** – Enables better forecasting and timeline commitments.  
- **Supports Resource Planning** – Coordinates work with availability and dependencies.  
- **Drives Accountability** – Helps assign and track responsibility for deadlines.  
- **Enables Critical Path Analysis** – Identifies time-sensitive tasks that impact project completion.

---

## Key Tools and Concepts

- Critical Path Method (CPM)  
- Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)  
- Gantt charts and network diagrams  
- Leads and lags  
- Schedule compression (crashing and fast tracking)  
- Monte Carlo simulation (for schedule risk analysis)

## Interactions with Other Knowledge Areas

- **Scope & Cost Management** – Work and cost estimates are built around the schedule.  
- **Resource Management** – Resource availability affects task sequencing and duration.  
- **Risk Management** – Helps identify and mitigate time-based risks.  
- **Communications Management** – Drives timely reporting and coordination.

Project Schedule Management provides the **temporal structure** that supports all other aspects of project planning and control.
