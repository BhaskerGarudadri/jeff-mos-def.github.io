## Process: Control Resources

**Process Group**: Monitoring and Controlling  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Resource Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Control Resources** process involves **ensuring that physical resources assigned and allocated to the project are available as planned**, and monitoring their use to detect and correct any deviations. This process focuses specifically on **physical resource availability and performance**, not team performance.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the resource management plan and resource requirements.
- **Project Documents** – Includes issue log, physical resource assignments, project schedule, and risk register.
- **Work Performance Data** – Tracks actual usage, availability, and condition of resources.
- **Agreements** – Contracts that specify delivery terms and obligations for external resources.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Policies for managing and reporting on physical resources.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Data Analysis**  
  - Alternatives analysis  
  - Cost-benefit analysis  
  - Performance reviews  
  - Trend analysis  

- **Problem Solving** – Identifying and resolving resource shortages, overuse, or conflicts.
- **Interpersonal and Team Skills** – Negotiation and influencing to resolve resource-related issues.
- **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** – Software to monitor, report, and track resource use.

---

## Outputs

- **Work Performance Information** – Processed data showing how resource usage aligns with the plan.
- **Change Requests** – Triggered if resource constraints require updates to schedule, scope, or cost.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Adjustments to the resource management plan or cost baseline.
- **Project Document Updates** – Revisions to the issue log, resource assignments, and risk register.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- Within the **Monitoring and Controlling Process Group**, Control Resources ensures **efficient and effective use of physical assets** throughout execution.
- As part of **Project Resource Management**, it safeguards project outcomes by detecting and responding to resource-related risks and inefficiencies.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Avoids Waste and Shortages** – Ensures resources are used efficiently and are available when needed.
- **Maintains Schedule and Cost Performance** – Prevents delays or overruns due to poor resource control.
- **Improves Decision-Making** – Enables proactive responses based on real-time resource data.
- **Supports Compliance** – Verifies that usage aligns with agreements, plans, and policies.
