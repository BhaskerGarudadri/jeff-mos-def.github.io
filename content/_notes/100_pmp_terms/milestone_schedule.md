A **Milestone Schedule** is a type of project schedule that **lists key milestones along with their planned dates**, without detailing the full set of activities required to reach them. It provides a **high-level view of significant events or decision points**, helping stakeholders quickly understand the project timeline and progress.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Simplified View** – Focuses on major outcomes, not detailed task-level planning.
- **Time-Oriented** – Emphasizes when milestones are expected to occur.
- **Communication Tool** – Often used in executive summaries, status reports, or stakeholder briefings.
- **Early Planning Utility** – Useful during initial planning when full details may not yet be available.

### **Use Cases**
- Gaining sponsor or client alignment on critical delivery points.
- Reporting project status without overwhelming detail.
- Structuring phase gates and contractually required checkpoints.

### **Example Milestone Schedule**
| Milestone                     | Planned Date  |
