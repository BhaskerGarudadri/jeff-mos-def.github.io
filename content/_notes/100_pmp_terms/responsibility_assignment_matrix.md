A **Responsibility Assignment Matrix** is a grid that shows the project resources assigned to each work package.

It maps the relationship between activities and responsible individuals or groups, ensuring that every component of project scope is owned and executed by an assigned resource.

## Key Characteristics

- **Scope-to-Resource Mapping** – Links work packages to assigned personnel or teams  
- **Clarity of Roles** – Defines who is responsible for what deliverable  
- **Enables Accountability** – Ensures all elements of the WBS are managed  
- **Supports Other Responsibility Models** – May be structured as a RACI or other variant  

## Example Scenarios

- Assigning individual engineers to specific modules in a software development project  
- Mapping construction teams to distinct phases of a site development plan  
- Using a RACI matrix to clarify roles for key scope deliverables  

## Role in Project Planning and Execution

- **Drives Role Clarity** – Avoids confusion around task ownership  
- **Improves Tracking** – Facilitates performance monitoring at the work package level  
- **Enhances Governance** – Strengthens internal controls by ensuring no scope is unassigned  
- **Supports Team Coordination** – Promotes alignment between scope, resources, and schedule  

## Example Responsibility Assignment Matrix

| Work Package                | Project Manager | Engineering Lead | Developer | QA Tester |
|----------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Requirements Definition    | A                | R                |           |           |
| System Architecture        | A                | R                | C         |           |
| Feature Development        | I                | A                | R         |           |
| Testing and Validation     | I                | C                |           | R         |
| Final Deployment           | A                | R                | C         | I         |
