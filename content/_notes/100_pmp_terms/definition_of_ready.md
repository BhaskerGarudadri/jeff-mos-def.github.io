The **Definition of Ready (DoR)** is a **team’s checklist that ensures a user-centric requirement contains all necessary information** before work begins. It establishes clear entry criteria for backlog items, reducing uncertainty and improving workflow efficiency.

## **Key Aspects of the Definition of Ready**
- **Ensures Work is Actionable** – User stories must be clear, testable, and well-defined.
- **Reduces Ambiguity** – Ensures all required details are available before work starts.
- **Improves Sprint Planning & Efficiency** – Prevents disruptions due to missing information.
- **Supports Agile & Scrum Teams** – Used in backlog refinement and sprint planning.

## **Example Definition of Ready Criteria**
| **Category**        | **Criteria** |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity**        | User story is well-defined and understandable. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Clear conditions define when the story is considered complete. |
| **Dependencies**   | All external dependencies are identified and resolved. |
| **Testability**    | The story includes test cases or validation methods. |
| **Estimate Provided** | The team has sized the work using story points or other estimation techniques. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
Before a user story enters a sprint, it must meet the **DoR**, ensuring it has **detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and UI/UX designs**.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A **content creation task** is considered **ready** when **target audience details, messaging guidelines, and approval workflows** are clearly defined.

### **Product Manufacturing**
A new production batch is considered **ready** when **design specifications, raw materials, and production schedules** are confirmed.

## **Why the Definition of Ready Matters**
- **Prevents Sprint Disruptions** – Reduces stalled work due to missing details.
- **Improves Team Efficiency** – Ensures work can begin immediately without delays.
- **Enhances Collaboration** – Aligns business, development, and testing teams on requirements.
- **Strengthens Backlog Quality** – Helps refine backlog items before sprint planning.
