# Opportunity

An **Opportunity** is a type of risk that, if it occurs, would have a **positive effect** on one or more portfolio, program, or project objectives. Unlike threats, which carry potential harm, opportunities represent **favorable uncertainties** that can lead to improved outcomes, strategic gains, or added value.

Opportunities are managed through intentional risk response strategies that aim to realize or enhance the potential benefit.

## Characteristics of Opportunity

- **Positive Risk** – Represents upside potential instead of danger.  
- **Outcome-Oriented** – Can improve scope, cost, schedule, quality, or value.  
- **Requires Management** – Needs identification, evaluation, and action planning.  
- **Not Guaranteed** – Like all risks, outcomes are uncertain until realized.  

## Example Scenarios

- A vendor offers early-delivery incentives that could shorten the schedule.  
- A breakthrough in technology enables faster production or higher quality.  
- Market demand unexpectedly rises, increasing product value.

## Common Response Strategies

- **Exploit** – Actively ensure the opportunity occurs.  
- **Enhance** – Increase probability or impact.  
- **Share** – Partner with another party to capture value.  
- **Accept** – Acknowledge the opportunity and monitor it passively.

## Why Opportunity Matters

- **Drives Competitive Advantage** – Turns uncertainty into strategic gain.  
- **Maximizes Project Value** – Enhances outcomes beyond baseline expectations.  
- **Encourages Proactive Thinking** – Shifts focus from only mitigating harm to capturing upside.  
- **Strengthens Portfolio Performance** – Enables better allocation of resources and focus.
