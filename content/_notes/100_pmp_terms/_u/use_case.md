A **Use Case** is an artifact for describing and exploring how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal.

It captures the interaction between an actor (typically a user or another system) and the system itself in order to accomplish a task or produce a result. Use cases provide structure for identifying requirements, validating functionality, and aligning system behavior with stakeholder needs.

## Key Characteristics

- **Goal-Oriented** – Focuses on what the user is trying to accomplish  
- **Scenario-Based** – Describes step-by-step interaction with the system  
- **Actor-Driven** – Initiated by a user or external system (the "actor")  
- **Supports Functional Requirements** – Helps define what the system must do  

## Example Scenarios

- A customer logs into an e-commerce platform to place an order  
- A project manager generates a status report from a dashboard  
- A system administrator resets a user password  

## Role in Requirements and Design

- **Improves Clarity** – Illustrates how a system will be used in real-world scenarios  
- **Supports Test Case Development** – Forms the basis for validating requirements  
- **Enhances Stakeholder Communication** – Bridges technical and non-technical understanding  
- **Feeds System Design** – Informs workflows, data flows, and interface design
