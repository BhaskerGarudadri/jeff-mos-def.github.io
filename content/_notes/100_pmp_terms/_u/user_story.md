A **User Story** is a brief description of an outcome for a specific user, which is a promise for a conversation to clarify details.

It captures a small piece of functionality from the perspective of the end user, written in simple language to promote understanding and discussion. User stories are commonly used in Agile to populate the product backlog and guide incremental delivery.

## Key Characteristics

- **Outcome-Focused** – Emphasizes what the user wants to achieve, not how  
- **Written in Plain Language** – Typically follows the format: *As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]*  
- **Encourages Collaboration** – Designed to trigger dialogue between stakeholders and the development team  
- **Supports Incremental Delivery** – Small and estimable, enabling fast feedback cycles  

## Example Scenarios

- *As a registered user, I want to reset my password so that I can access my account securely*  
- *As a project manager, I want to view a real-time dashboard so that I can track team progress*  
- *As a customer, I want to save items to a wishlist so that I can purchase them later*  

## Role in Agile Delivery

- **Drives Backlog Refinement** – Forms the basis of prioritization and estimation  
- **Supports Acceptance Criteria Definition** – Helps define the Definition of Done  
- **Enables User-Centered Design** – Keeps the focus on delivering user value  
- **Feeds Planning and Review** – Guides sprint planning and sprint reviews
