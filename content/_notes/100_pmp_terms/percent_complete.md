**Percent Complete** is an **estimate expressed as a percentage** that reflects the amount of work completed on a specific **activity** or **work breakdown structure (WBS) component**. It is a commonly used metric for tracking project progress and determining how much of the planned work has been accomplished at a given point in time.

This metric supports earned value management, forecasting, and performance evaluation throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Characteristics

- **Quantitative Measure** – Expressed as a numeric percentage (0%–100%)  
- **Activity or WBS-Based** – Can apply at task, work package, or control account level  
- **Subjective or Objective** – May rely on judgment, deliverable milestones, or actual effort  
- **Supports Status Reporting** – Regularly updated in project dashboards and reports

## Example Scenarios

- A task with 6 out of 10 sub-tasks finished is marked as 60% complete  
- A deliverable is considered 100% complete only after client approval  
- A feature that passed initial testing but awaits integration may be marked as 80% complete

## Why Percent Complete Matters

- **Tracks Work Progress** – Provides a snapshot of current completion status  
- **Enables Forecasting** – Helps estimate time and effort remaining  
- **Supports Performance Metrics** – Used in earned value calculations (e.g., EV)  
- **Improves Visibility** – Keeps stakeholders informed of real-time progress
