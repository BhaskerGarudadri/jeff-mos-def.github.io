**Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** is a measure of schedule efficiency expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value.

It quantifies how efficiently the project is progressing compared to the schedule baseline and is a key metric in earned value management.

## Key Characteristics

- **Performance Ratio** – Compares progress achieved (EV) to progress planned (PV)  
- **Indicator of Schedule Health** – SPI = 1.0 means on schedule; < 1.0 is behind; > 1.0 is ahead  
- **Time-Focused** – Measures schedule effectiveness, not duration or cost  
- **Used with EVM Metrics** – Often paired with CPI for broader performance analysis  

## Example Scenarios

- An SPI of 0.80 indicates only 80% of planned work has been completed  
- An SPI greater than 1.0 shows faster progress than expected  
- Used in trend analysis to forecast project completion timing  

## Formula

$$
\text{SPI} = \frac{EV}{PV}
$$

Where:  
- **EV** = Earned Value  
- **PV** = Planned Value  

## Role in Project Monitoring and Control

- **Supports Forecasting** – Informs schedule-based estimates at completion  
- **Triggers Corrective Action** – Helps identify when schedule recovery is needed  
- **Enhances Communication** – Provides objective performance insight to stakeholders  
- **Feeds Into Trend Analysis** – Tracks performance across reporting periods
