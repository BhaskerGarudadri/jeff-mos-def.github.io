A **Schedule Management Plan** is a component of the program or project management plan that establishes the criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule.

It defines the framework for how the schedule will be structured, updated, reported, and managed, ensuring consistency and control across the project timeline.

- Defining the use of scheduling software like Primavera or MS Project  
- Specifying thresholds for when schedule variances require formal escalation
