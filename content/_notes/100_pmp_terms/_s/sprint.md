A **Sprint** is a timeboxed interval within a project during which a usable and potentially releasable increment of a product is created.

Sprints provide a consistent rhythm for delivery, learning, and improvement in agile frameworks such as Scrum. Each sprint starts and ends with specific events that enable planning, execution, inspection, and adaptation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Fixed Duration** – Typically lasts 1 to 4 weeks  
- **Delivers Value** – Produces a working increment that meets the Definition of Done  
- **Includes Key Ceremonies** – Structured events frame each sprint for alignment and improvement  
- **Does Not Change Once Started** – Scope may be clarified but not altered mid-sprint  

## Example Scenarios

- Developing a working login module by the end of a 2-week sprint  
- Demonstrating completed features to stakeholders during a sprint review  
- Holding a retrospective to reflect and identify improvements  

## Common Sprint Ceremonies

| Ceremony              | Purpose                                                      | Timing                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Sprint Planning       | Define sprint goal, select backlog items, and plan work      | Beginning of the sprint    |
| Daily Scrum           | Synchronize team activity and plan next 24 hours             | Every day during the sprint|
| Sprint Review         | Inspect the increment and gather stakeholder feedback        | End of the sprint          |
| Sprint Retrospective  | Reflect and identify improvements for the next sprint        | After the sprint review    |

## Role in Agile Delivery

- **Supports Predictable Cadence** – Enables regular delivery and stakeholder engagement  
- **Drives Focus and Discipline** – Limits scope and encourages commitment  
- **Promotes Continuous Improvement** – Embeds learning through structured feedback loops  
- **Aligns Work to Goals** – Keeps teams focused on producing valuable outcomes
