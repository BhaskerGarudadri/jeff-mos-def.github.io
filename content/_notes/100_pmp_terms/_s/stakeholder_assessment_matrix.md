A **Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix** is a matrix that compares current and desired stakeholder engagement levels.

It is a diagnostic tool used to assess how engaged stakeholders are at a given time versus how engaged they need to be for project success. This gap analysis informs targeted strategies to increase, maintain, or reduce engagement appropriately.

## Key Characteristics

- **Comparison-Based** – Identifies differences between current and target engagement states  
- **Qualitative** – Uses descriptive levels (e.g., unaware, resistant, neutral, supportive, leading)  
- **Action-Oriented** – Supports planning specific engagement activities  
- **Dynamic** – Updated as stakeholder positions evolve over time  

## Example Scenarios

- Identifying a key stakeholder who is currently resistant but needs to be supportive  
- Recognizing that a subject matter expert is unaware of the project and must become involved  
- Tracking progress in shifting engagement over multiple reporting periods  

## Example Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix

## Sample Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix

| Stakeholder         | Current Engagement | Desired Engagement | Gap Identified? | Engagement Strategy                         |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Project Sponsor     | Supportive         | Leading             | Yes              | Increase involvement in reviews and planning |
| Functional Manager  | Resistant          | Supportive          | Yes              | Address concerns through one-on-one meetings |
| End User Rep        | Neutral            | Supportive          | Yes              | Include in demos and usability feedback      |
| Legal Department    | Unaware            | Aware               | Yes              | Send updates and compliance briefings        |
| Product Owner       | Leading            | Leading             | No               | Maintain current engagement and visibility   |

### Engagement Levels Key

- **Unaware** – Not aware of the project or potential impacts  
- **Resistant** – Aware but opposed to the project  
- **Neutral** – Neither supportive nor resistant  
- **Supportive** – Aware and supportive of the project  
- **Leading** – Actively engaged in ensuring project success

## Role in Stakeholder Engagement Planning

- **Informs Strategy** – Guides communication and involvement approaches  
- **Supports Prioritization** – Helps focus effort on high-impact stakeholders  
- **Improves Alignment** – Bridges engagement gaps that threaten project outcomes  
- **Feeds into the Stakeholder Engagement Plan** – Directly shapes tactics and messaging
