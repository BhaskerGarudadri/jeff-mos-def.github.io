A **Stakeholder Engagement Plan** is a component of the program or project management plan that identifies the strategies and actions required to promote productive involvement of stakeholders in program or project decision-making and execution.

It defines how stakeholders will be engaged based on their interests, influence, and impact, and outlines communication methods, frequency, and responsibilities to ensure sustained alignment and support throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Characteristics

- **Strategically Aligned** – Tailored to stakeholder needs, roles, and engagement levels  
- **Action-Oriented** – Includes specific approaches and tactics for each stakeholder group  
- **Dynamic and Iterative** – Reviewed and updated as stakeholder positions or project conditions change  
- **Integrated with Communication Planning** – Supports messaging, cadence, and access to information  

## Example Scenarios

- Specifying monthly one-on-one sessions with a high-influence sponsor  
- Planning weekly updates for a user group involved in UAT  
- Establishing escalation protocols for stakeholder concerns
