A **Schedule Baseline** is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed using formal change control procedures and is used as the basis for comparison to actual results.

It establishes the authorized timeline for project execution and control, allowing the project team to measure performance, track deviations, and enforce accountability throughout the lifecycle.

## Key Characteristics

- **Formally Approved** – Authorized by stakeholders and subject to change control  
- **Used for Performance Tracking** – Serves as the reference for measuring actual progress  
- **Integrated with Other Baselines** – Aligns with scope and cost baselines as part of the performance measurement baseline  
- **Supports Forecasting and Control** – Enables earned value analysis and trend evaluation  

## Example Scenarios

- Comparing actual task completion dates to baseline milestones  
- Using schedule variance and schedule performance index to assess progress  
- Updating the schedule baseline after approval of a major scope change  

## Role in Project Management

- **Enables Schedule Control** – Identifies early and late trends against planned timelines  
- **Supports Change Governance** – Ensures updates are managed through formal processes  
- **Drives Accountability** – Clarifies when, where, and why delays occur  
- **Facilitates Integrated Planning** – Aligns time management with scope and budget
