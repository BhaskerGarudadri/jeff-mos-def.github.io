A **Sprint Review** is a collaborative review session where the team demonstrates the work that was completed during the sprint to stakeholders and solicits their feedback.

It promotes transparency and alignment by showcasing the product increment, discussing what was completed and what remains, and collecting input that may influence the product backlog or future direction.

## Key Characteristics

- **Team-Led Demonstration** – Shows completed work that meets the Definition of Done  
- **Stakeholder Participation** – Involves users, customers, sponsors, and other stakeholders  
- **Feedback-Oriented** – Encourages open discussion and course correction  
- **Adapts the Product Backlog** – May result in new items or reprioritization  

## Example Scenarios

- A development team demoing a new reporting feature to stakeholders for validation  
- Stakeholders suggesting UI changes during the review of the current sprint output  
- The product owner updating the backlog after receiving stakeholder input  

## Role in Agile Delivery

- **Promotes Transparency** – Gives stakeholders visibility into real progress  
- **Supports Continuous Improvement** – Allows refinement of direction and focus  
- **Strengthens Engagement** – Builds shared ownership of the product’s success  
- **Feeds Iteration Planning** – Informs backlog grooming for upcoming sprints
