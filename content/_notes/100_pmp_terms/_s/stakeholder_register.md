A **Stakeholder Register** is a project document that includes information about project stakeholders including an assessment and classification of project stakeholders.

It serves as the central record of stakeholder identities, roles, interests, influence, and engagement requirements, and supports the development of tailored communication and involvement strategies throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Characteristics

- **Comprehensive Record** – Lists all individuals, groups, and organizations relevant to the project  
- **Includes Classification Data** – Assesses influence, interest, impact, and engagement level  
- **Supports Engagement Planning** – Feeds into the stakeholder engagement plan  
- **Evolving Document** – Updated as new stakeholders are identified or existing ones change  

## Example Scenarios

- Identifying stakeholders and categorizing them during project initiation  
- Updating the register to reflect a change in organizational leadership  
- Using classification data to develop targeted communication approaches
