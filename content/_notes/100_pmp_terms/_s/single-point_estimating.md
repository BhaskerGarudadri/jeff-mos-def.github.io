**Single-Point Estimating** is an estimating method that involves using data to calculate a single value that reflects a best guess estimate.

It provides one numeric estimate for cost, duration, or effort, based on expert judgment, historical information, or assumptions, and does not account for variability or uncertainty.

## Key Characteristics

- **Single Value Output** – Offers one estimate rather than a range  
- **Simple and Quick** – Less complex than three-point or probabilistic estimating  
- **Assumption-Driven** – Based on a defined set of known inputs and conditions  
- **Limited Risk Consideration** – Does not explicitly account for variability or confidence levels  

## Example Scenarios

- Estimating a task will take exactly 5 days based on a similar past effort  
- Using vendor pricing to estimate procurement cost without adjustment  
- Assigning a $10,000 estimate to a deliverable based on expert opinion  

## Role in Project Estimating

- **Useful in Early Stages** – Applied when limited information is available  
- **Feeds Baseline Development** – Supports creation of schedule and cost baselines  
- **Requires Validation** – Best used alongside risk assessments or contingency plans  
- **Less Accurate Under Uncertainty** – May lead to rework or variance when conditions shift
