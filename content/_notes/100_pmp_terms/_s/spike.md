A **Spike** is a timeboxed user story or task that is created in order to research a question or resolve a problem.

It is used when a team needs more information or technical clarity before committing to a feature or solution, allowing investigation without derailing delivery. The outcome of a spike is typically new knowledge, a prototype, or a recommendation that informs future work.

## Key Characteristics

- **Timeboxed** – Has a fixed duration to limit impact on velocity  
- **Exploratory in Nature** – Focused on understanding, experimentation, or analysis  
- **Produces Insight, Not Deliverables** – Result may be documentation, a technical approach, or feasibility analysis  
- **Created Like a User Story** – Added to the backlog, prioritized, and estimated  

## Example Scenarios

- Investigating the best third-party API for integration before building the connection  
- Exploring performance issues in a prototype to determine root cause  
- Researching technology options to inform an architecture decision  

## Role in Agile Planning and Delivery

- **Reduces Uncertainty** – Clarifies unknowns before committing to work  
- **Improves Estimation Accuracy** – Enables better planning by gathering essential details  
- **Protects Sprint Goals** – Isolates risk and discovery work without disrupting delivery flow  
- **Feeds the Product Backlog** – Informs or results in follow-up stories or technical tasks
