A **Scope Management Plan** is a component of the program or project management plan that describes how the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated.

It outlines the processes and criteria for managing project scope throughout the lifecycle, ensuring that all deliverables are clearly identified, approved, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

## Key Characteristics

- **Defines Scope Processes** – Includes steps for scope definition, documentation, and validation  
- **Supports Scope Control** – Establishes thresholds and procedures for managing changes  
- **Ensures Alignment** – Links scope with objectives, requirements, and stakeholder priorities  
- **Integral to Planning and Execution** – Guides creation of the scope baseline and WBS  

## Example Scenarios

- Detailing the approach for collecting and documenting requirements  
- Establishing a formal process for scope verification and acceptance  
- Defining how scope changes must be proposed, reviewed, and approved  

## Common Elements of a Scope Management Plan

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope Definition Process    | Describes how project scope will be determined and structured               |
| Work Breakdown Structure    | Specifies how the WBS will be created and maintained                        |
