**Scope Creep** is the uncontrolled expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources.

It typically occurs when new features, deliverables, or requirements are introduced without formal approval or alignment with the change control process, leading to increased workload, budget strain, and potential schedule overruns.

## Key Characteristics

- **Unapproved Expansion** – Occurs outside of formal change management procedures  
- **Impacts Project Performance** – Affects time, cost, and quality if left unaddressed  
- **Often Incremental** – Arises through gradual additions or informal stakeholder requests  
- **Prevention-Oriented** – Mitigated through rigorous scope definition and control  

## Example Scenarios

- A client requesting “just one more feature” that gets added without a change request  
- Developers implementing enhancements that weren’t in the original requirements  
- A project team delivering beyond the approved WBS due to miscommunication  

## Role in Scope and Change Management

- **Threatens Project Constraints** – Leads to imbalance in scope-time-cost triangle  
- **Undermines Planning** – Disrupts baselines and control systems  
- **Requires Strict Governance** – Emphasizes the importance of change control procedures  
- **Calls for Stakeholder Alignment** – Ensures all additions are reviewed, approved, and resourced
