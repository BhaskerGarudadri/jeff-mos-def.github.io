**Work in Process (WIP)** refers to the project tasks or activities that are in progress but have not yet been completed.

It represents work that has been started but not yet delivered or validated. Managing WIP is critical in Agile and Lean environments, where limiting the amount of simultaneous work increases efficiency, reduces context switching, and improves flow.

## Key Characteristics

- **In-Progress State** – Includes any work item that has been initiated but not finished  
- **Visualized in Boards** – Often tracked on Kanban or task boards under “In Progress” or equivalent  
- **Subject to Limits** – Capped through WIP limits to improve throughput and reduce bottlenecks  
- **Measured for Flow Efficiency** – Impacts cycle time and task aging  

## Example Scenarios

- A developer working on a feature that is not yet ready for review  
- A team member writing documentation that has not been finalized  
- A test case that has been executed but the results are still being analyzed  

## Role in Agile and Process Management

- **Enhances Predictability** – Smaller, managed WIP improves delivery consistency  
- **Reduces Multitasking Waste** – Limits task switching and overload  
- **Supports Flow-Based Metrics** – Affects cycle time, throughput, and lead time  
- **Improves Delivery Cadence** – Encourages focus and completion before starting new work
