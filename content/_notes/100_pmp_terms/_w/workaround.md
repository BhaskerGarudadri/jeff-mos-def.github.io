A **Workaround** is an immediate and temporary response to a realized risk for which a prior response has not been planned or was not effective.

It is a reactive measure implemented to address unexpected problems or failures in real time, allowing the project to continue while a more permanent solution is evaluated or implemented. Workarounds are documented and tracked as part of issue and risk management processes.

## Key Characteristics

- **Unplanned and Reactive** – Not part of the original risk response strategy  
- **Temporary in Nature** – Enables continued progress while longer-term solutions are considered  
- **Used After Risk Realization** – Applied when mitigation or avoidance has failed or was absent  
- **Requires Documentation** – Recorded in issue logs and may feed future risk planning  

## Example Scenarios

- Manually entering data when a system integration fails  
- Using alternate suppliers on short notice due to unexpected vendor disruption  
- Reassigning tasks when a key resource becomes unavailable without warning  

## Role in Risk and Issue Management

- **Maintains Continuity** – Keeps the project moving despite unexpected setbacks  
- **Supports Agility** – Allows teams to respond quickly in dynamic environments  
- **Feeds Lessons Learned** – Provides insight for future risk identification and planning  
- **May Influence Change Control** – Workarounds can lead to formal changes in scope or plan
