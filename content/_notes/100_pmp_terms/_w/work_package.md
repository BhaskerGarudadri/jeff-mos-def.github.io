A **Work Package** is the work defined at the lowest level of the work breakdown structure for which cost, effort, duration, and resources are estimated and managed.

It is the smallest unit of work in the WBS that can be planned, assigned, tracked, and controlled. Work packages serve as the foundation for developing schedules, budgets, and performance baselines and are often associated with a single responsible entity.

## Key Characteristics

- **Lowest-Level WBS Element** – Cannot be further broken down in the WBS hierarchy  
- **Fully Estimable** – Duration, cost, and resource requirements are known or planned  
- **Accountable** – Assigned to a team or individual for ownership and delivery  
- **Supports Control Accounts** – Aggregated into higher-level tracking structures  

## Example Scenarios

- A 3-day task to configure a software module with one developer assigned  
- Procurement of materials for a construction component under a single contract  
- Creation of a training video for a new product feature  

## Role in Planning and Execution

- **Enables Detailed Planning** – Basis for building the project schedule and budget  
- **Improves Accuracy and Control** – Supports monitoring, forecasting, and performance analysis  
- **Aligns with Deliverables** – Tied to scope elements that contribute to project objectives  
- **Facilitates Performance Measurement** – Used in Earned Value Management (EVM) systems
