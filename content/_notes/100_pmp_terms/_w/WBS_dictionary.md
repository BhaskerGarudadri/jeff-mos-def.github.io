A **WBS Dictionary** is a document that provides detailed deliverable, activity, scheduling, cost, and resource information about each component in the work breakdown structure.

It complements the WBS by supplying the supporting information necessary to define the scope and manage the work associated with each element. The WBS dictionary ensures clarity, consistency, and traceability across all levels of the project structure.

## Key Characteristics

- **Component-Specific** – One entry for each WBS element  
- **Detail-Oriented** – Includes descriptions, assumptions, constraints, and acceptance criteria  
- **Supports Scope Control** – Helps manage change and prevents scope creep  
- **Linked to Planning Artifacts** – Tied to schedule, cost, and resource plans  

## Example Scenarios

- Defining work package requirements and dependencies for a construction phase  
- Listing responsible resources and estimated durations for a software development task  
- Documenting acceptance criteria and cost estimates for a project deliverable  

## Role in Project Planning and Control

- **Clarifies Work Expectations** – Ensures all team members understand what is to be delivered  
- **Enables Consistent Tracking** – Supports status reporting, verification, and validation  
- **Integrates Scope with Schedule and Cost** – Provides a foundation for performance measurement  
- **Strengthens Documentation** – Helps align stakeholder understanding of project components
