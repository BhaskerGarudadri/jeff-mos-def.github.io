**Waste** consists of activities that consume resources and/or time without adding value.

These non-value-adding activities increase cost, delay delivery, and reduce overall efficiency. Identifying and eliminating waste is a core principle of Lean thinking and supports continuous improvement across projects, programs, and portfolios.

## Key Characteristics

- **Value-Neutral or Negative** – Adds no benefit to the customer or end outcome  
- **Resource-Consuming** – Uses time, money, or effort with no return  
- **Often Hidden** – Embedded in processes as delays, rework, or excess output  
- **Targeted for Elimination** – Addressed through Lean, Agile, and Six Sigma practices  

## Example Scenarios

- Requiring unnecessary approvals that slow down progress  
- Producing documentation that no stakeholder uses  
- Waiting for inputs from other teams with no alternative task ready  
- Reworking deliverables due to unclear or changing requirements  

## Role in Process Improvement

- **Improves Flow Efficiency** – Streamlines processes for faster delivery  
- **Reduces Cost** – Eliminates unnecessary spending and overhead  
- **Increases Focus on Value** – Aligns team efforts with what matters to stakeholders  
- **Drives Cultural Change** – Promotes a mindset of continuous evaluation and improvement
