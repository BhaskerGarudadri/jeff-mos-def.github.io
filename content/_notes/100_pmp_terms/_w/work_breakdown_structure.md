A **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

It organizes and defines the full scope of the project by breaking down deliverables and work into manageable components. The WBS provides a framework for detailed planning, assignment of responsibilities, tracking, and control.

## Key Characteristics

- **Deliverable-Oriented** – Structured around what must be produced, not how  
- **Hierarchical** – Broken down from major project components into smaller work packages  
- **Supports Project Integration** – Aligns scope, schedule, cost, and resources  
- **Basis for Planning and Control** – Used to develop estimates, track progress, and manage change  

## Example Scenarios

- A software project WBS breaking down application development into UI, backend, testing, and deployment components  
- A construction project WBS organizing work by phases such as site prep, foundation, framing, and finishing  
- A marketing campaign WBS outlining deliverables like branding, social media, content, and launch  

## Role in Project Planning and Execution

- **Defines Total Project Scope** – Ensures all work is identified and accounted for  
- **Enables Accurate Estimating** – Supports cost, time, and resource planning at granular levels  
- **Improves Accountability** – Clarifies ownership of each component or work package  
- **Facilitates Performance Measurement** – Links to control accounts and earned value metrics
