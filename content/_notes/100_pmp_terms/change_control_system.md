The **Change Control System** is a **set of procedures** that describes how modifications to **project deliverables and documentation** are **managed and controlled**. It ensures that all changes are properly evaluated, approved, and tracked throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Aspects of a Change Control System
- **Defines Change Management Processes** – Establishes structured procedures for handling change requests.
- **Ensures Formal Approval** – Requires authorization before implementing modifications.
- **Tracks All Changes** – Maintains a record of approved, rejected, and pending change requests.
- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Controls modifications to avoid uncontrolled expansion of project scope.

## Components of a Change Control System
1. **Change Request Process** – Defines how changes are submitted, reviewed, and approved.
2. **Impact Assessment Criteria** – Evaluates the effect of proposed changes on scope, schedule, cost, and risk.
3. **Change Control Board (CCB) Oversight** – Assigns authority to approve or reject changes.
4. **Change Documentation & Tracking** – Maintains records of all change requests and decisions.
5. **Communication & Implementation Procedures** – Ensures stakeholders are informed and changes are properly executed.

## Example Scenario

### **Software Development**
A software project uses a **Change Control System** to track requests for **new features, bug fixes, and technical improvements**. Each request is reviewed for **impact on cost, schedule, and system stability** before approval.

### **Construction Project**
A **Change Control System** ensures that **design changes** go through a structured approval process, preventing unauthorized modifications that could **affect structural integrity and budget**.

### **Business Operations**
A financial institution applies a **Change Control System** to **govern updates to compliance policies**, ensuring that all regulatory changes are properly documented and approved.

## Why a Change Control System Matters
- **Standardizes Change Management** – Provides a structured approach for handling modifications.
- **Improves Decision-Making** – Ensures that changes are evaluated before implementation.
- **Enhances Project Control** – Reduces uncertainty and minimizes disruptions.
- **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment** – Keeps project teams, sponsors, and customers informed.
