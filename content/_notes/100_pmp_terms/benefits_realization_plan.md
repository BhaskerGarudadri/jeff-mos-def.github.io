- **Establishes a Timeline** – Identifies when benefits will be achieved (short-term, mid-term, long-term).
- **Allocates Resources** – Details the tools, personnel, and funding necessary for benefit realization.
- **Includes Monitoring & Measurement** – Defines metrics and reporting methods for tracking progress.
