# Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)

**Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** are the **plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases** that are specific to and used by the performing organization. These assets influence how projects are planned and executed by providing guidance, templates, and historical information.

OPAs are internal to the organization and evolve over time through continuous learning and project experience.

## Key Components of OPAs

- **Policies and Procedures** – Standards for project execution and control  
- **Templates and Guidelines** – Documents for planning, tracking, and reporting  
- **Historical Information** – Lessons learned, risk logs, project archives  
- **Knowledge Repositories** – Databases, wikis, and libraries of best practices  

## Example Scenarios

- A project manager reuses a stakeholder register template stored in the PMO’s shared drive  
- The team consults archived post-mortem reports to identify common risk triggers  
- The organization mandates use of its internal quality assurance procedures

## Why Organizational Process Assets Matter

- **Standardizes Execution** – Promotes consistency across projects  
- **Improves Efficiency** – Saves time by reusing proven tools and templates  
- **Enables Knowledge Transfer** – Preserves institutional memory and practices  
- **Supports Governance** – Ensures alignment with internal policies and expectations
