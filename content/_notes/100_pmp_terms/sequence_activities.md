## Process: Sequence Activities

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Schedule Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Sequence Activities** process involves **identifying and documenting relationships among project activities**. It establishes the **logical order in which tasks must be performed**, enabling the creation of a network diagram that supports scheduling, duration estimation, and critical path analysis.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the schedule management plan that defines dependency types and constraints.
- **Project Documents** – Includes the activity list, activity attributes, milestone list, and assumptions log.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Scheduling tools, organizational culture, and project calendar standards.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Templates, historical sequencing data, and standard dependency libraries.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)** – The primary technique used to visualize activities and their logical relationships:
  - Finish-to-Start (FS)  
  - Start-to-Start (SS)  
  - Finish-to-Finish (FF)  
  - Start-to-Finish (SF)  

- **Dependency Determination and Integration** – Identifies:
  - Mandatory dependencies (hard logic)  
  - Discretionary dependencies (soft logic)  
  - External dependencies  
  - Internal dependencies  

- **Leads and Lags** – Adjustments to dependencies to represent overlaps (leads) or delays (lags) between tasks.
- **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** – Software tools used to visualize and sequence activities.

---

## Outputs

- **Project Schedule Network Diagram** – A graphical representation of activities and their dependencies.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to the activity list, attributes, and assumptions based on sequencing decisions.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- In the **Planning Process Group**, Sequence Activities creates the **logical structure** required before durations can be estimated or a full schedule developed.
- Within **Project Schedule Management**, it links the defined work into a flow that reflects **time, order, and constraints**.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Enables Accurate Scheduling** – Dependencies must be established to calculate timelines.
- **Supports Critical Path Analysis** – Identifies the sequence that will determine the project’s duration.
- **Improves Resource Coordination** – Ensures tasks are logically ordered to avoid conflicts or bottlenecks.
- **Clarifies Execution Strategy** – Makes clear what must happen when, and what depends on what.
