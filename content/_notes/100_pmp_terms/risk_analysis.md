**Risk Analysis** is the activities related to defining the characteristics of a risk and the degree to which it can impact objectives.

It involves evaluating the nature, probability, and potential consequences of identified risks to inform prioritization, response planning, and decision-making.

## Key Characteristics

- **Evaluative in Nature** – Focuses on understanding likelihood and impact  
- **Supports Prioritization** – Helps determine which risks require attention  
- **Forms the Basis for Response** – Informs the selection of appropriate risk strategies  
- **Can Be Qualitative or Quantitative** – Uses descriptive or numerical methods  

## Example Scenarios

- Assessing the probability and schedule impact of a vendor delay  
- Using a probability and impact matrix to rank project risks  
- Running Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate overall project risk exposure  

## Role in Risk Management

- **Enhances Decision-Making** – Provides data for proactive risk handling  
- **Improves Resource Allocation** – Focuses efforts on high-priority risks  
- **Feeds into Risk Response Planning** – Ensures tailored, effective actions  
- **Supports Communication** – Clarifies risk exposure to stakeholders
