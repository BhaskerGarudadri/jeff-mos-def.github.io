A **Release Plan** is the plan that sets expectations for the dates, features, and/or outcomes expected to be delivered over the course of multiple iterations.

It provides a high-level schedule that guides delivery efforts, aligns stakeholder expectations, and ensures that incremental value is delivered according to a coordinated roadmap.

## Key Characteristics

- **Time-Boxed Planning** – Outlines features or deliverables by iteration or release window  
- **Outcome-Oriented** – Focuses on customer-facing value, not just internal tasks  
- **Flexible and Adaptive** – Can evolve based on progress, feedback, or shifting priorities  
- **Aligns With Strategy** – Connects release timing to business or product goals  

## Example Scenarios

- Planning quarterly software releases with defined scope for each sprint  
- Coordinating cross-team dependencies across releases in a large-scale program  
- Outlining delivery milestones in advance of a major product launch  

## Role in Project Management

- **Drives Visibility** – Sets clear expectations for what will be delivered and when  
- **Enables Coordination** – Aligns teams, resources, and stakeholders around shared timelines  
- **Supports Incremental Delivery** – Breaks down large initiatives into manageable units  
- **Feeds Into the Project Management Plan** – Informs integrated scheduling and scope baselines
