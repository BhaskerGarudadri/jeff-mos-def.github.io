## Purpose

The **Identify Risks** process involves **identifying individual project risks and sources of overall project risk**, documenting their characteristics, and creating a foundation for qualitative and quantitative analysis. It is a continuous, collaborative effort involving the full project team and key stakeholders.

- **Procurement Documentation** – Risk considerations related to suppliers or third-party services.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Industry risk factors, regulatory environment, and risk tolerance.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Historical risk data, checklists, templates, and prior project files.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Sourced from stakeholders, team members, and subject matter experts.
- **Data Gathering**  
  - Brainstorming
