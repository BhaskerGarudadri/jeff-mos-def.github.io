An **Epic** is a **large, related body of work** that serves to **hierarchically organize a set of requirements** and **deliver specific business outcomes**. Epics help structure work at a **higher level than user stories**, ensuring that large initiatives are **managed and broken down effectively**.

## **Key Aspects of an Epic**
- **High-Level Work Item** – Represents a major feature, initiative, or business goal.
- **Breaks Down into User Stories** – Decomposed into smaller, actionable tasks.
- **Used in Agile Frameworks** – Common in Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe® for backlog organization.
- **Tied to Business Outcomes** – Ensures alignment with strategic objectives.

## **Epic vs. User Story vs. Theme**
| **Work Item** | **Description** | **Example** |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Theme** | A broad business objective or strategic goal. | "Enhance Customer Experience" |
| **Epic** | A major initiative contributing to the theme. | "Implement a New Customer Support System" |
| **User Story** | A specific, actionable requirement. | "As a user, I want to chat with support in real-time." |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A **tech company** launches an **epic for AI-powered search enhancements**, which includes stories for **improving autocomplete, voice search, and filtering options**.

### **Marketing Strategy**
A **marketing team** creates an **epic for a product launch campaign**, with stories covering **social media ads, email promotions, and video production**.

### **Manufacturing Process Improvement**
A **factory implements an epic for automation**, with tasks focusing on **robotic assembly, process optimization, and predictive maintenance**.

- **Enhance Backlog Management** – Helps prioritize and refine large initiatives.
- **Ensure Business Alignment** – Connects work to strategic goals.
