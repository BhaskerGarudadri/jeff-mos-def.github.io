**Acceptance criteria** define the conditions that must be met for a deliverable to be accepted. These criteria ensure that project outputs align with stakeholder expectations and predefined requirements. They provide a clear [[ benchmarking.md |benchmark]] for project completion and quality assurance.

## Key Aspects of Acceptance Criteria
- **Objective and Measurable** – Each criterion should be specific enough to be tested or verified.
- **Agreed Upon by Stakeholders** – Defined collaboratively to align expectations.
- **Tied to Requirements** – Directly linked to project requirements to confirm deliverables meet the intended purpose.
- **Used for Validation** – Help determine if work is complete and meets customer or business needs.

## Examples of Acceptance Criteria

### Software Development
- A login page must allow users to enter a valid email and password and receive an authentication response within two seconds.
- A dashboard must display real-time sales data with an accuracy of ±5%.

### Construction Project
- The foundation must be completed within three weeks and pass an independent structural integrity test.
- All installed windows must meet energy efficiency standards and pass quality inspections.

### Marketing Campaign
- A social media ad campaign must achieve at least a 5% engagement rate before being marked as successful.
- A new website launch must support at least 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

## Why Acceptance Criteria Matter
- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Ensures work aligns with the project scope, avoiding unnecessary changes.
- **Enhances Communication** – Provides clarity between project teams and stakeholders.
- **Supports Testing & Validation** – Serves as a reference for quality assurance and user acceptance testing (UAT).
