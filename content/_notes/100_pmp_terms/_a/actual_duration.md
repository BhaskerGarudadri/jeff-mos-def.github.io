**Actual Duration** is the total time, measured in calendar units, between the actual start date of a scheduled activity and either the project’s data date (if the activity is in progress) or the actual finish date (if the activity is complete). It provides a real measure of how long an activity has taken compared to initial estimates.

## Key Aspects of Actual Duration
- **Reflects Real Execution Time** – Measures the true time spent on an activity.
- **Dynamic Measure** – If an activity is ongoing, the actual duration is updated up to the current data date.
- **Used for Performance Tracking** – Compared against planned duration to assess schedule efficiency.
- **Expressed in Calendar Units** – Typically measured in days, weeks, or months.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development Project**
- *Planned Duration for Feature Development:* 10 days  
- *Actual Start Date:* March 1  
- *Actual Finish Date:* March 14  
- *Actual Duration:* 14 days (delayed by 4 days)

### **Construction Project**
- *Planned Duration for Foundation Work:* 20 days  
- *Actual Start Date:* April 10  
- *Data Date (Current Status):* April 25 (Work still in progress)  
- *Actual Duration:* 15 days (as of April 25)

## Why Actual Duration Matters
- **Enhances Schedule Accuracy** – Helps refine future project time estimates.
- **Supports Performance Analysis** – Used to compare planned vs. actual execution times.
- **Aids in Delay Management** – Identifies potential schedule risks early.
