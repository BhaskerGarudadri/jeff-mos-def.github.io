An **adaptive approach** is a development methodology used when project requirements are highly uncertain or subject to frequent changes. This approach prioritizes flexibility, iterative progress, and continuous feedback to accommodate evolving needs.

## Key Aspects of an Adaptive Approach
- **Emphasizes Flexibility** – Responds to changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Incremental & Iterative Delivery** – Delivers work in small, manageable increments.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration** – Engages stakeholders regularly to refine project scope and direction.
- **Continuous Learning & Adjustment** – Adapts based on feedback, market conditions, or new insights.

## When to Use an Adaptive Approach
- **High Uncertainty** – When requirements are unclear or expected to change.
- **Rapidly Evolving Markets** – Where customer needs and technology trends shift frequently.
- **Innovative Projects** – When developing new products or services with unknown variables.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development (Agile)**
- A tech startup uses an adaptive approach to develop a mobile app. The initial scope is broad, but features are defined incrementally based on user feedback.
- New feature requests are integrated into future development cycles through sprints.

### **Construction & Design**
- An interior design firm follows an adaptive approach, allowing clients to make iterative design decisions rather than finalizing all specifications upfront.

## Why an Adaptive Approach Matters
- **Reduces Risk** – Adjusts scope and priorities based on real-time feedback.
- **Improves Customer Satisfaction** – Ensures deliverables align with evolving needs.
- **Enhances Team Efficiency** – Allows teams to pivot quickly without wasting resources.
