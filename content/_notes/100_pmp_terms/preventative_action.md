# Preventive Action

**Preventive Action** is an **intentional activity** taken to ensure that **future performance of the project work remains aligned with the project management plan**. It is a proactive measure aimed at **avoiding potential deviations**, issues, or risks before they occur, and is often implemented as part of quality assurance and risk response planning.

Preventive actions support the stability, consistency, and predictability of project execution.

## Key Characteristics

- **Proactive** – Initiated before a problem or deviation arises  
- **Standards-Driven** – Based on expectations defined in the project management plan  
- **Process-Focused** – Often improves methods, workflows, or tools to prevent failure  
- **Continuous Improvement** – Supports long-term project and organizational maturity

## Example Scenarios

- Implementing code review procedures to prevent future defects  
- Conducting training sessions to avoid misinterpretation of requirements  
- Adjusting schedules or resources in advance to reduce workload conflicts

## Why Preventive Action Matters

- **Reduces Future Risk** – Helps avoid delays, defects, and cost overruns  
- **Improves Consistency** – Strengthens adherence to plans, standards, and methods  
- **Supports Quality Assurance** – Ensures work aligns with defined expectations
