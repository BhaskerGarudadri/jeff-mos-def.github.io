**Regression Analysis** is an analytical method where a series of input variables are examined in relation to their corresponding output results in order to develop a mathematical or statistical relationship.

This method is used to predict outcomes, evaluate trends, and quantify the influence of specific factors on project performance.

## Key Characteristics

- **Quantitative Technique** – Applies mathematical modeling to historical data  
- **Identifies Relationships** – Examines correlations between variables and outcomes  
- **Supports Forecasting** – Projects future performance based on past behavior  
- **Used in Cost and Schedule Estimating** – Enhances accuracy of predictions  

## Example Scenarios

- Using historical project size and team hours to predict future labor needs  
- Analyzing cost drivers across similar projects to refine budget estimates  
- Evaluating the impact of design changes on delivery timelines  

## Role in Performance Analysis

- **Improves Estimate Accuracy** – Refines predictive models using real project data  
- **Enables Data-Driven Decisions** – Supports objective planning and control  
- **Enhances Root Cause Analysis** – Clarifies drivers behind variances  
- **Strengthens Performance Measurement** – Links inputs to outputs for better oversight
