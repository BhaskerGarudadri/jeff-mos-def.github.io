**Scope Baseline** is the approved version of formal scope documents that can be changed using formal change control procedures and is used as the basis for comparison to actual results.

It defines the agreed-upon scope of the project, including all deliverables and work to be performed, and serves as a reference for monitoring and controlling scope throughout the lifecycle of the project.

## Key Characteristics

- **Formally Approved** – Authorized through the integrated change control process  
- **Composed of Key Documents** – Includes the scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary  
- **Used for Performance Comparison** – Tracks scope deviations and variances  
- **Integral to the Performance Measurement Baseline** – Works alongside cost and schedule baselines  

## Example Scenarios

- Comparing completed work to WBS-defined deliverables during performance reviews  
- Identifying and documenting scope creep outside the approved baseline  
- Updating the scope baseline after change request approval  

## Scope Baseline Components

| Component         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Scope Statement | Describes project deliverables and the work required to create them       |
| Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) | Hierarchical decomposition of total project work                          |
| WBS Dictionary    | Detailed information about each WBS element, including deliverables and criteria |

## Role in Scope and Project Management

- **Ensures Clarity and Alignment** – Defines what is and isn’t included in the project  
- **Supports Scope Control** – Enables detection and correction of unauthorized changes  
- **Improves Accountability** – Clarifies expectations for all stakeholders  
- **Facilitates Integrated Planning** – Aligns with time, cost, and quality baselines
