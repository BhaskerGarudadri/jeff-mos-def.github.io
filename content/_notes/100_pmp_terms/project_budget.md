The **Project Budget** is the **sum of work package cost estimates**, **contingency reserve**, and **management reserve**. It represents the total authorized financial resources available to execute the project and account for known and unknown risks.

The project budget serves as a financial baseline and is essential for monitoring performance, controlling costs, and ensuring resource alignment.

## Key Characteristics

- **Comprehensive Total** – Includes estimated costs plus reserves  
- **Structured by Work Package** – Derived from the work breakdown structure  
- **Incorporates Risk Reserves** – Covers both identified (contingency) and unforeseen (management) risks  
- **Controlled Through Baselines** – Tracked against the cost baseline during execution

## Example Scenarios

- A project budget includes $1.2M in direct costs, $100K in contingency, and $50K in management reserve  
- A construction project draws from contingency when material prices increase  
- Management reserves are tapped after a major scope change is approved

## Role in Cost Management

- **Supports Financial Planning** – Defines the full cost scope for delivery  
- **Enables Performance Monitoring** – Used for variance analysis and control  
- **Mitigates Risk** – Provides financial flexibility for uncertainty  
- **Establishes Accountability** – Sets expectations for resource use and oversight
