An **Objective** is something toward which work is to be directed. It may be a **strategic position to be attained, a purpose to be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed**.

Objectives provide clear direction and measurable intent across projects, programs, and portfolios. They form the foundation for defining scope, prioritizing efforts, and evaluating success.

## Characteristics of an Objective

- **Action-Oriented** – Represents a clear, purposeful target  
- **Strategically Aligned** – Supports organizational goals or mission  
- **Measurable** – Tied to quantifiable outcomes or performance indicators  
- **Time-Bound** – Intended to be achieved within a defined timeframe  

## Example Scenarios

- Launch a mobile app that reduces customer support requests by 25%  
- Achieve a 10% increase in operational efficiency within two quarters  
- Expand service offerings to three new markets by year-end

- **Enables Strategic Execution** – Connects daily work to high-level vision  
- **Drives Prioritization** – Helps allocate time and resources effectively
