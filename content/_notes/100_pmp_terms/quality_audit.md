A **Quality Audit** is a **structured, independent process** used to **determine if project activities comply with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures**. It is performed to verify adherence to standards and to identify areas for improvement in how the project is being executed.

Quality audits are a critical part of continuous improvement and quality assurance efforts within project management.
