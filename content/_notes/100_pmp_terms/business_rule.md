A **Business Rule** is a **constraint on how an organization operates**, enforced by **data, processes, or policies**. Business rules define **acceptable behavior, decision-making criteria, and operational limitations**, ensuring compliance with company policies and regulations.

## Key Aspects of Business Rules
- **Govern Operations** – Define how business processes must function.
- **Enforced by Data & Processes** – Applied through systems, workflows, or policies.
- **Within Business Jurisdiction** – Controlled and maintained by the organization.
- **Require Solution Support** – Must be implemented through business or system requirements.

## Types of Business Rules
- **Decision Rules** – Define conditions for making business decisions.  
  *Example: A loan application is rejected if the credit score is below 600.*
- **Process Rules** – Establish how workflows should function.  
  *Example: Invoices must be approved by a manager before payment is issued.*
- **Data Rules** – Control data integrity and formatting.  
  *Example: Customer IDs must be unique and follow a standardized format.*
- **Regulatory Rules** – Ensure compliance with legal or industry standards.  
  *Example: Healthcare data must be stored in compliance with HIPAA regulations.*

## Example Scenarios

### **E-Commerce**
- Orders over **$500 require manual approval** before processing.

### **Banking & Finance**
- **Interest rates are calculated based on customer credit score** and loan term.

### **Healthcare**

## Why Business Rules Matter
- **Ensure Compliance** – Maintain alignment with legal and regulatory requirements.
- **Improve Consistency** – Standardize decision-making and operational workflows.
- **Enhance Process Efficiency** – Reduce ambiguity and automate business operations.
- **Support System Implementation** – Provide clear guidelines for software and process development.
