An **assumption** is a factor in the planning process that is considered to be true, real, or certain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions help define project expectations but introduce potential risks if they prove incorrect.

## Key Aspects of Assumptions
- **Influence Project Planning** – Affect scope, schedule, budget, and risk assessments.
- **Require Documentation** – Should be recorded and validated to reduce uncertainty.
- **May Introduce Risk** – Unverified assumptions can lead to project issues if they prove false.
- **Should Be Monitored** – Regularly reviewed as the project progresses.

## Assumption Categories
- **Technical Assumptions** – Beliefs about system capabilities, technology availability, or integration feasibility.
- **Business Assumptions** – Expectations about market demand, stakeholder engagement, or funding stability.
- **Resource Assumptions** – Availability of personnel, materials, or external vendors.
- **Regulatory Assumptions** – Compliance with laws and policies that may change over time.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A project assumes that an API will be available for integration, but later finds out that it requires additional licensing, causing delays.

### **Construction Project**
A team assumes that building permits will be approved within two weeks. If the approval process takes longer, the project schedule is impacted.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A marketing team assumes that a key influencer will participate in a campaign, but the influencer later declines, requiring a change in strategy.

## Why Assumptions Matter
- **Affect Decision-Making** – Influence planning and resource allocation.
- **Can Lead to Project Risks** – Incorrect assumptions can create delays and budget overruns.
- **Require Validation** – Should be reviewed through research, expert opinions, or contingency planning.
