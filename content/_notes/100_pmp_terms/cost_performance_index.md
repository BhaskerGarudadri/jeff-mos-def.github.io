The **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** is a **measure of cost efficiency** in a project, expressed as the **ratio of Earned Value (EV) to Actual Cost (AC)**. It indicates how effectively the project is using its budgeted resources.

## **CPI Formula**
\[
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}
\]
Where:
- **EV (Earned Value):** The budgeted cost of completed work.
- **AC (Actual Cost):** The actual expenditure for completed work.

## **Interpreting CPI**
| **CPI Value**  | **Meaning** |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **CPI > 1.0** | The project is **under budget** (cost-efficient). |
| **CPI = 1.0** | The project is **on budget** (cost efficiency is as expected). |
| **CPI < 1.0** | The project is **over budget** (cost overruns are occurring). |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A software project has an **EV of $200,000** and an **AC of $180,000**:
$$
CPI = \frac{200,000}{180,000} = 1.11
$$
**Interpretation:** The project is under budget and utilizing resources efficiently.

### **Construction Project**
A construction project has an **EV of $500,000** and an **AC of $550,000**:
$$
CPI = \frac{500,000}{550,000} = 0.91
$$
**Interpretation:** The project is over budget, requiring cost control measures.

### **Manufacturing**
A production line has an **EV of $1,000,000** and an **AC of $1,000,000**:
$$
CPI = \frac{1,000,000}{1,000,000} = 1.0
$$

**Interpretation:** The project is operating exactly as budgeted.

## **Why CPI Matters**
- **Helps Track Cost Efficiency** – Provides real-time insight into project spending.
- **Enables Forecasting** – Used to predict future budget needs.
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Helps determine whether corrective actions are needed.
- **Enhances Cost Control** – Prevents budget overruns through early detection.
