A **Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Contract** is a **type of fixed-price contract where the buyer pays the seller a set amount** as defined in the contract, **regardless of the seller’s actual costs**. This contract places the **financial risk on the seller**, incentivizing cost efficiency.

## **Key Aspects of Firm-Fixed-Price Contracts**
- **Price Is Set in Advance** – The agreed-upon price does not change, even if costs fluctuate.
- **Minimal Buyer Risk** – The seller absorbs any cost overruns.
- **Requires Clear Scope Definition** – Works best when deliverables and expectations are well-defined.
- **Common in Government & Large Contracts** – Frequently used in public sector projects and manufacturing.

## **FFP vs. Other Contract Types**
| **Contract Type**          | **Description** | **Risk to Buyer** | **Risk to Seller** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP)** | Fixed total price, regardless of actual costs. | **Low** | **High** |
| **Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)** | Buyer reimburses costs plus a fixed profit. | **Moderate** | **Low** |
| **Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF)** | Buyer reimburses costs, with incentives for performance. | **Moderate** | **Moderate** |
| **Time & Materials (T&M)** | Buyer pays for time and resources used. | **High** | **Low** |
