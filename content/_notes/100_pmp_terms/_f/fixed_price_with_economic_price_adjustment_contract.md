A **Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA) Contract** is a **fixed-price contract that includes a provision allowing for predefined adjustments to the price** due to **external economic conditions**, such as **inflation, currency fluctuations, or changes in material costs**. This contract protects both buyers and sellers from unpredictable cost changes.

## **Key Aspects of FPEPA Contracts**
- **Fixed Base Price** – The contract sets an initial agreed-upon amount.
- **Adjustment Mechanism** – Price adjustments are triggered by predefined conditions.

## **Triggers for Price Adjustments**

| **Inflation Rate Changes** | Adjustments based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). |
| **Raw Material Cost Variability** | Price modifications for key commodities like steel, oil, or electronics. |
| **Exchange Rate Fluctuations** | Compensation for currency value shifts in international contracts. |
