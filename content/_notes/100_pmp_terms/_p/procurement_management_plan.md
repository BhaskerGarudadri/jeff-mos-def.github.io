**Procurement Management Plan** is a component of the **program or project management plan** that defines **how goods and services will be acquired from external sources**. It outlines procurement procedures, roles and responsibilities, contract types, evaluation criteria, and risk considerations related to third-party vendors or suppliers.

This plan ensures procurement activities align with the overall project objectives and organizational policies.

- **Establishes Process Controls** – Specifies procurement workflows, templates, and approval paths  
- **Includes Contracting Guidance** – Outlines preferred contract types and terms  
- **Aligns with Risk Management** – Addresses supplier risks and mitigation approaches

## Example Scenarios
