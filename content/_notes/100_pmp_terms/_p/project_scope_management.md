## Overview: Project Scope Management

**Project Scope Management** involves the processes required to **ensure that the project includes all the work—and only the work—required** to complete the project successfully. It defines and controls what is and is not included in the project.

---

## Purpose

Scope Management helps ensure that the project:

- Delivers only what was agreed upon  
- Avoids scope creep  
- Accurately defines boundaries and deliverables  
- Aligns stakeholder expectations with project outcomes  

This knowledge area provides clarity around **what the project is delivering** and how that delivery will be structured and verified.

---

## Key Characteristics

- Foundational to cost, schedule, and quality accuracy  
- Heavily reliant on stakeholder input  
- Enables structured work decomposition  
- Requires ongoing validation and control

## Core Processes in Project Scope Management

| Process | Process Group | Purpose |
|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| **Plan Scope Management** | Planning | Establishes how scope will be defined, validated, and controlled. |
| **Collect Requirements** | Planning | Gathers detailed stakeholder needs and expectations to inform scope. |
| **Define Scope** | Planning | Develops a detailed project and product scope statement. |
| **Create WBS** | Planning | Breaks down deliverables into manageable components through a Work Breakdown Structure. |
| **Validate Scope** | Monitoring and Controlling | Formalizes stakeholder acceptance of completed deliverables. |
| **Control Scope** | Monitoring and Controlling | Monitors scope status and manages scope change requests.

## Why Project Scope Management Matters

- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Ensures that all changes are evaluated and approved before implementation.  
- **Improves Accuracy** – Provides the foundation for reliable schedule and cost estimates.  
- **Clarifies Boundaries** – Avoids confusion over what’s in or out of scope.  
- **Supports Quality and Satisfaction** – Delivers what was promised and what stakeholders expect.

---

## Key Tools and Concepts

- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  
- Scope statement and scope baseline  
- Requirements traceability matrix  
- Change control processes  
- Decomposition and progressive elaboration

## Interactions with Other Knowledge Areas

- **Cost & Schedule Management** – Scope defines what needs to be estimated and when.  
- **Quality Management** – Verifies that only in-scope deliverables are inspected.  
- **Stakeholder Management** – Ensures expectations are aligned with the defined scope.  
- **Risk Management** – Identifies scope-related risks early in the lifecycle.

Project Scope Management is about **building the right thing, the right way, and only what’s required**—nothing more, nothing less.
