The **Project Calendar** is a **calendar that identifies working days and shifts** available for **scheduled activities**. It defines the timeframes during which project work can be performed, accounting for holidays, weekends, non-working days, and specific resource availability.

The project calendar plays a key role in accurate scheduling, duration estimation, and resource planning.

## Key Characteristics

- **Defines Work Periods** – Specifies allowable working days and hours  
- **Accounts for Non-Work Time** – Includes holidays, weekends, and scheduled breaks  
- **Supports Resource Planning** – Aligns team availability with task scheduling  
- **Used in Schedule Models** – Applied to tasks and resources within project scheduling tools

## Example Scenarios

- A global project includes separate calendars for regional teams with different holidays  
- Night shift availability is defined for a construction schedule with 24/7 operations  
- A project calendar is modified to include blackout periods during system maintenance windows

## Role in Project Scheduling

- **Enables Accurate Planning** – Ensures realistic activity durations and sequencing  
- **Prevents Conflicts** – Avoids scheduling work during unavailable periods  
- **Aligns with Resource Constraints** – Matches tasks to working hours and team capacity  
- **Improves Forecast Reliability** – Supports timeline accuracy by reflecting real-world constraints
