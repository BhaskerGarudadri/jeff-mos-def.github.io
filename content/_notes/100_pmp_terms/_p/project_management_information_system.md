A **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** is an **information system consisting of the tools and techniques used to gather, integrate, and disseminate the outputs of project management processes**. It supports project planning, execution, monitoring, and control by providing real-time data and centralized access to critical project information.

A PMIS enables informed decision-making, transparency, and performance tracking across all phases of the project.

## Key Characteristics

- **Tool Integration** – Combines scheduling, budgeting, risk, and document management systems  
- **Centralized Access** – Offers a single source of truth for project data and artifacts  
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Provides real-time metrics and dashboards  
- **Enables Collaboration** – Connects team members, stakeholders, and resources

## Example Scenarios

- A project team uses a cloud-based PMIS to manage schedules, track progress, and submit updates  
- The PMIS automatically generates status reports and variance analyses for leadership  
- Risk logs, procurement records, and change requests are stored and shared within the system

## Role in Project Control

- **Improves Data Accuracy and Access** – Ensures timely and consistent information  
- **Enhances Monitoring and Reporting** – Supports KPIs, baselines, and forecast reviews  
- **Enables Standardization** – Enforces templates, workflows, and documentation practices  
- **Supports Scalability** – Can be expanded across multiple projects or programs
