The **Program Management Plan** is a **document that integrates the program’s subsidiary plans** and establishes the **management controls and overall strategy** for **coordinating and managing the program’s individual components**. It serves as the central reference for how the program will be executed, monitored, and controlled across its life cycle.

This plan ensures alignment between projects, governance frameworks, and strategic objectives.
