**Progressive Elaboration** is the **iterative process of increasing the level of detail in a project management plan** as **greater amounts of information and more accurate estimates become available**. It allows project teams to refine scope, schedule, and cost progressively as work advances and uncertainty decreases.

This technique enables adaptive planning without sacrificing long-term vision, particularly useful in dynamic or evolving environments.

## Key Characteristics

- **Iterative Detailing** – Plans are expanded and refined over time  
- **Driven by New Information** – Incorporates discoveries and clarifications as work progresses  
- **Supports Accurate Forecasting** – Improves precision in estimates and commitments  
- **Flexible Within Structure** – Allows adaptability without losing control

## Example Scenarios

- A project begins with high-level requirements and adds detailed design plans as technical constraints are clarified  
- Early budget estimates are refined after vendor quotes and contract terms are secured  
- The team builds out near-term tasks in detail while leaving later phases at a higher level until closer to execution

## Role in Project Planning

- **Improves Estimation Accuracy** – Reduces risk of overcommitment or underestimation  
- **Supports Evolving Projects** – Useful when all information is not known upfront  
- **Aligns Detail with Timing** – Enables just-in-time planning where appropriate  
- **Enhances Stakeholder Confidence** – Reflects updated understanding as progress is made
