**Portfolio Balancing** is the process of **optimizing the mix of portfolio components**—including projects, programs, and operations—to best support and advance the **strategic objectives** of the organization. It involves making deliberate decisions about what to start, continue, modify, defer, or terminate based on factors such as value, risk, resource availability, and alignment.

Balancing ensures the portfolio delivers **maximum value** while staying within organizational constraints.

## Key Characteristics

- **Strategic Filtering** – Ensures every component contributes to enterprise goals  
- **Dynamic Process** – Continuously adjusted as business needs evolve  
- **Tradeoff Management** – Balances risk, value, cost, benefit, and timing  
- **Data-Driven** – Based on performance data, forecasts, and resource models

## Example Scenarios

- A company shifts investment from underperforming programs to high-growth initiatives  
- Redundant projects are eliminated to free up resources for priority efforts  
- Risk-heavy projects are reduced in favor of more stable, lower-return efforts that support sustainability goals

## Why Portfolio Balancing Matters

- **Maximizes Strategic Value** – Prioritizes initiatives that deliver the greatest return  
- **Controls Risk Exposure** – Diversifies and manages portfolio-level risk  
- **Improves Agility** – Enables fast reallocation of resources based on changing conditions  
- **Enhances Governance** – Provides structure for objective, high-impact decisions
