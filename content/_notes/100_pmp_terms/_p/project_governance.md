The **Project Governance** framework defines the **functions and processes that guide project management activities** to ensure the project **meets or exceeds its target objectives**. It establishes accountability, decision-making authority, escalation paths, and control mechanisms for consistent and transparent delivery.

Project governance provides structure and oversight to keep the project aligned with organizational standards and strategic goals.

## Key Characteristics

- **Decision-Making Structure** – Identifies roles, responsibilities, and approval rights  
- **Oversight Mechanisms** – Includes checkpoints, reviews, and performance audits  
- **Escalation and Control** – Defines how issues, risks, and changes are managed  
- **Strategic and Tactical Alignment** – Ensures project direction stays in sync with enterprise objectives

## Example Scenarios

- A steering committee reviews progress and authorizes key phase transitions  
- Governance policies require formal approval of major scope or budget changes  
- A governance framework includes monthly reporting, risk reviews, and stakeholder briefings

## Role in Project Oversight

- **Ensures Accountability** – Clarifies who makes decisions and who owns outcomes  
- **Improves Transparency** – Provides visibility into performance and risks  
- **Supports Consistency** – Aligns project execution with organizational practices  
- **Enables Timely Escalation** – Prevents delays and misalignment through structured intervention
