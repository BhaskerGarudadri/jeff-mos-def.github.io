The **Project Life Cycle** is the **series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion**. Each phase represents a logical grouping of activities that contribute to the delivery of the project’s objectives, including initiation, planning, execution, and closing.

It provides a structured path for managing work, allocating resources, and applying controls throughout the life of the project.

## Key Characteristics

- **Phase-Based Structure** – Divides the project into manageable segments  
- **Sequential or Overlapping** – Can follow linear, iterative, or hybrid models  
- **Aligned with Deliverables** – Each phase culminates in specific outputs or milestones  
- **Supports Control and Oversight** – Facilitates checkpoints, reviews, and decision gates

## Example Scenarios

- A construction project moves through design, permitting, building, and inspection phases  
- A technology project follows initiation, planning, development, testing, and launch  
- An event planning effort proceeds from concept to logistics, delivery, and post-event wrap-up

## Role in Project Delivery

- **Organizes Work** – Breaks down large efforts into logical steps  
- **Enables Tracking and Control** – Provides milestones for assessing progress  
- **Improves Forecasting** – Clarifies scope, time, and resource requirements at each stage  
- **Supports Governance** – Aligns with reviews, approvals, and quality checks
