**Project Scope** is the **work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions**. It defines the boundaries of the project—what is included and what is excluded—and establishes a shared understanding among stakeholders about what will be delivered.

Managing project scope is essential for controlling expectations, preventing scope creep, and aligning deliverables with business objectives.

## Key Characteristics

- **Defines Deliverables** – Specifies what will be produced by the project  
- **Bounded by Requirements** – Includes only agreed-upon features, functions, and work  
- **Drives Planning and Execution** – Informs schedule, resource, and cost planning  
- **Controlled Through Change Management** – Changes to scope require formal approval

## Example Scenarios

- A website redesign project includes UX design, development, testing, and migration—but excludes content creation  
- An ERP implementation covers finance and HR modules but defers procurement to a later phase  
- A training development project delivers course materials and virtual sessions but not instructor recruitment

## Role in Project Management

- **Aligns Stakeholders** – Sets clear expectations about what will and won’t be delivered  
- **Supports Performance Tracking** – Enables measurement of work against defined scope  
- **Improves Cost and Time Estimates** – Reduces ambiguity for more accurate forecasting  
- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Provides a baseline for managing change and resisting unplanned additions
