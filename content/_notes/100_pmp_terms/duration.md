**Duration** is the **total number of work periods required to complete an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component**, typically expressed in **hours, days, or weeks**. It differs from **effort**, which refers to the total labor hours expended.

## **Key Aspects of Duration**
- **Measures Time to Complete Work** – Tracks how long an activity takes.
- **Excludes Non-Working Time** – Calculated using available work periods.
- **Can Be Estimated or Actual** – Used in both planning and execution phases.
- **Differs from Effort** – Effort measures total work hours, while duration focuses on elapsed time.

## **Duration vs. Effort**
| **Concept**  | **Definition** | **Example** |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Duration** | The total time span required to complete an activity. | A software feature takes **5 days** to complete. |
| **Effort** | The total work hours spent on an activity. | A developer spends **40 hours** coding the feature. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A **bug fix** has a **duration of 2 days**, but since multiple developers contribute, the **effort totals 16 hours**.

### **Construction Project**
Laying **the foundation for a building** has a duration of **2 weeks**, considering available work shifts.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A **product launch event** is planned over a **3-month duration**, though the actual **effort spent is spread across multiple tasks**.

## **Why Duration Matters**
- **Improves Schedule Accuracy** – Helps project teams estimate realistic timelines.
- **Supports Workload Management** – Balances tasks across team availability.
- **Enables Critical Path Analysis** – Identifies scheduling constraints.
- **Helps Forecast Project Completion** – Essential for planning and tracking.
