## Overview: Project Risk Management

**Project Risk Management** includes the processes of **planning, identifying, analyzing, responding to, implementing, and monitoring project risks**. It ensures that both threats and opportunities are actively managed to improve project outcomes.

---

## Purpose

The goal of Risk Management is to:

- Minimize negative impacts (threats)  
- Maximize positive outcomes (opportunities)  
- Promote proactive rather than reactive decision-making  
- Improve project predictability and resilience  

It applies structured thinking to **uncertainty**, enabling the project team to anticipate, plan for, and respond to change.

---

## Key Characteristics

- Applies to both individual risks and overall project risk  
- Involves the entire project team and key stakeholders  
- Requires iteration as the project evolves  
- Relies on both qualitative and quantitative analysis

## Core Processes in Project Risk Management

| Process | Process Group | Purpose |
|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| **Plan Risk Management** | Planning | Defines how risk activities will be structured and carried out. |
| **Identify Risks** | Planning | Catalogs uncertainties that may affect the project. |
| **Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis** | Planning | Prioritizes risks based on probability and impact. |
| **Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis** | Planning | Assigns numerical values to risk exposure and project uncertainty. |
| **Plan Risk Responses** | Planning | Determines how to address threats and opportunities. |
| **Implement Risk Responses** | Executing | Executes planned risk mitigation or enhancement actions. |
| **Monitor Risks** | Monitoring and Controlling | Tracks risk status, detects new risks, and evaluates response effectiveness.

## Why Project Risk Management Matters

- **Reduces Surprises** – Identifies and addresses potential problems before they occur.  
- **Improves Outcomes** – Proactively captures opportunities to enhance project success.  
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Equips teams with data to assess options and make informed choices.  
- **Protects Project Objectives** – Ensures scope, schedule, cost, and quality are safeguarded against uncertainty.

## Key Tools and Concepts

- Risk register and risk report  
- Probability and impact matrix  
- Monte Carlo simulation  
- Sensitivity analysis and expected monetary value (EMV)  
- Contingency and management reserves  
- Risk categories and prompt lists (e.g., PESTLE, TECOP)

## Interactions with Other Knowledge Areas

- **Scope, Schedule, and Cost Management** – Risks affect estimates, reserves, and baselines.  
- **Stakeholder Management** – Risk perceptions and tolerances vary by stakeholder.  
- **Procurement Management** – Includes risk-sharing through contracts and vendor obligations.  
- **Integration Management** – Aligns risk responses across planning and execution.

Project Risk Management enables teams to **face uncertainty with a plan**, turning unknowns into manageable, strategic elements of project success.
