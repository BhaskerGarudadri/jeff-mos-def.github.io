A **Configuration Management System** is a **collection of procedures** used to **track project artifacts** and **monitor and control changes** to these artifacts. It ensures that project documentation, deliverables, and baselines remain consistent, controlled, and traceable throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Aspects of a Configuration Management System
- **Tracks Project Artifacts** – Manages documents, software versions, design specifications, and deliverables.
- **Monitors & Controls Changes** – Ensures modifications follow an approved process.
- **Maintains Consistency** – Prevents unauthorized changes or discrepancies in project components.
- **Supports Compliance & Auditing** – Provides a record of changes for governance and quality assurance.

## Components of a Configuration Management System
1. **Configuration Identification** – Defines what artifacts will be managed and tracked.
2. **Configuration Control** – Establishes procedures for reviewing and approving changes.
3. **Configuration Status Accounting** – Maintains logs of changes, approvals, and versions.
4. **Configuration Audits** – Ensures compliance with standards and validates accuracy.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A company uses a **Configuration Management System** to track **code changes, software versions, and feature deployments**, ensuring version control and rollback capability.

### **Construction Project**
A **building project** uses configuration management to **control blueprints, material specifications, and design revisions**, preventing misalignment between teams.

### **Manufacturing**
A **factory production system** tracks **equipment settings, process adjustments, and product specifications** to ensure quality control and regulatory compliance.

## Why a Configuration Management System Matters
- **Ensures Change Control** – Prevents unauthorized modifications to project artifacts.
- **Improves Quality Management** – Maintains consistency in project deliverables.
- **Enhances Traceability & Auditing** – Provides a historical record of changes.
- **Reduces Risk & Errors** – Avoids miscommunication and inconsistencies in critical project documents.
