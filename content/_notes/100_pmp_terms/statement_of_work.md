A **Statement of Work (SOW)** is a narrative description of products, services, or results to be delivered by the project.

It defines the work requirements, deliverables, and boundaries of the engagement, providing a clear understanding of what is to be performed, under what conditions, and to what standards. The SOW is often used in both internal planning and external procurement.

## Key Characteristics

- **Narrative Format** – Describes work scope in detailed written form  
- **Deliverable-Focused** – Identifies the specific products, services, or results required  
- **Defines Acceptance Criteria** – Establishes quality expectations and completion standards  
- **Legally Binding in Contracts** – Serves as a key document in supplier agreements  

## Example Scenarios

- A construction firm providing a SOW outlining materials, labor, and completion timeline  
- An IT vendor including a SOW in a contract for system implementation  
- A project manager drafting an internal SOW to define scope boundaries with functional teams  

## Role in Scope and Procurement Management

- **Clarifies Work Expectations** – Ensures all parties understand the scope of work  
- **Supports Scope Control** – Acts as a baseline to assess proposed changes  
- **Drives Procurement Processes** – Used to solicit, evaluate, and contract vendors  
- **Feeds Project Planning** – Supports creation of WBS, scope baseline, and schedule
