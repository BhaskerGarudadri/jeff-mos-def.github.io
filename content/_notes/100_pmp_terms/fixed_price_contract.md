A **Fixed-Price Contract** is an **agreement that sets a predetermined fee** for a **defined scope of work**, regardless of the **actual cost or effort required to deliver it**. This contract type **transfers financial risk to the seller**, ensuring cost stability for the buyer.

## **Key Aspects of Fixed-Price Contracts**
- **Price Is Set in Advance** – The total cost is agreed upon before work begins.
- **Risk Falls on the Seller** – The contractor absorbs any cost overruns.
- **Requires Well-Defined Scope** – Works best when deliverables are clearly specified.
- **Common in Vendor and Government Contracts** – Often used for procurement and outsourced work.

## **Types of Fixed-Price Contracts**
| **Contract Type**          | **Description** | **Best Use Case** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP)** | A fixed amount is agreed upon, with no adjustments. | Standard projects with well-defined scope. |
| **Fixed-Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)** | The seller can earn additional payments based on performance targets. | Projects where efficiency and cost savings are incentivized. |
| **Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA)** | Adjusts pricing based on external economic conditions (e.g., inflation, currency rates). | Long-term contracts where cost fluctuations are likely. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A company **hires a vendor to develop a website** for **\$50,000**, regardless of development time.

### **Construction Project**
A **contractor agrees to build an office building** for **\$2 million**, covering materials and labor.

### **Manufacturing**
A **supplier provides 10,000 circuit boards** at a **fixed price per unit**, ensuring cost stability.

## **Why Fixed-Price Contracts Matter**
- **Provides Cost Predictability** – Buyers know project costs upfront.
- **Reduces Financial Risk for Buyers** – Sellers bear any cost overruns.
- **Encourages Efficiency from Sellers** – Contractors manage budgets effectively.
- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Requires well-defined requirements.
