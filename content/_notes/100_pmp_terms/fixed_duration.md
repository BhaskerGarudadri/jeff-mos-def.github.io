**Fixed Duration** is a **type of activity where the length of time required to complete the activity remains constant**, regardless of **the number of people or resources assigned**. This means that increasing or decreasing resources **does not affect the duration** of the task.

## **Key Aspects of Fixed Duration**
- **Time Required Is Constant** – Task duration is independent of resource allocation.
- **More Resources Do Not Reduce Time** – Unlike effort-driven tasks, duration remains the same.
- **Common in Regulatory & Natural Constraints** – Used when external factors dictate the timeline.
- **Affects Resource Allocation** – Teams may need to plan resource distribution carefully.

## **Fixed Duration vs. Effort-Driven Work**
| **Concept**  | **Description** | **Example** |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Fixed Duration** | Duration remains the same, even if more people are assigned. | A **24-hour stress test** on a server takes the same time, regardless of engineers monitoring it. |
| **Effort-Driven Work** | Duration changes based on resource allocation. | Writing a **100-page report** takes less time if more writers contribute. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A **security vulnerability scan** runs for **48 hours**, regardless of how many engineers monitor it.

### **Construction Project**
Concrete **curing time is fixed at 7 days**, regardless of additional labor availability.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A **product launch event lasts 3 days**, no matter how many marketers are assigned.

## **Why Fixed Duration Matters**
- **Ensures Time-Sensitive Activities Stay on Track** – Helps in scheduling regulatory and testing phases.
- **Prevents Misallocation of Resources** – Avoids unnecessary resource additions where time is non-adjustable.
- **Improves Scheduling Accuracy** – Helps in planning work that cannot be compressed.
- **Supports Risk & Dependency Management** – Ensures critical path tasks are well understood.
