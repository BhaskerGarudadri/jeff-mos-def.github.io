A **Minimum Business Increment (MBI)** is the **smallest unit of deliverable functionality** that provides **real, usable value to the business**. Unlike technical tasks or partial features, an MBI is **complete enough to be deployed and offer measurable business benefit** on its own. The concept supports incremental delivery, enabling organizations to realize value sooner while reducing time-to-market and limiting risk.

### **Purpose and Characteristics**
- **Business-Centric** – Focused on customer or stakeholder value, not just technical completeness.
- **Independent Value** – Can be released without requiring other increments to deliver benefit.
- **Fast Feedback** – Enables quicker validation of ideas through real-world usage.
- **Supports Prioritization** – Helps teams focus on the most valuable, minimal scope needed to move forward.

### **Example Scenarios**
- A bank releases a new online deposit feature that allows users to scan and upload checks—a fully functional unit that solves a business problem.
- A healthcare platform rolls out a minimal appointment reminder system via SMS that improves patient engagement, even before broader portal features are complete.

### **MBI vs. MVP vs. MMF**
| Concept | Focus              | Goal                                |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **MBI** | Business Value     | Deliver smallest releasable value   |
| **MVP** | Customer Learning  | Test assumptions with minimal effort|
| **MMF** | Market Viability   | Offer first market-ready functionality|

### Why MBIs Matter

- Accelerate Value Delivery – Help organizations release meaningful updates faster.
- Reduce Waste – Avoid overbuilding by focusing only on what delivers business impact.
- Enhance Agility – Allow teams to respond to changing priorities without losing progress.
