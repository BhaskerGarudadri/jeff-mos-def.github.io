A **Process** is a **systematic series of activities** directed toward causing an **end result**, such that **one or more inputs are acted upon** to produce **one or more outputs**. Processes are the foundational building blocks of project, program, and portfolio work, enabling consistent, repeatable execution.

Each process transforms inputs using tools, techniques, and resources to deliver outputs that contribute to achieving objectives.

## Key Characteristics

- **Structured Sequence** – Follows a defined order of steps  
- **Input-Driven** – Requires one or more inputs to initiate  
- **Output-Focused** – Delivers measurable or usable results  
- **Repeatable** – Can be applied consistently across efforts

## Example Scenarios

- The change control process takes change requests as input and results in approved or rejected changes  
- The procurement process transforms specifications into signed contracts  
- The quality assurance process reviews deliverables and produces conformance reports

## Why Process Matters

- **Enables Consistency** – Standardizes how work is performed across initiatives  
- **Improves Efficiency** – Reduces ambiguity and rework through structured steps  
- **Supports Quality** – Ensures predictable, validated outputs  
- **Facilitates Integration** – Aligns components across project phases and disciplines
