The **Assumption Log** is a project document used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project lifecycle. It helps track factors that are believed to be true and ensures they are validated, monitored, and updated as necessary.

## Key Aspects of an Assumption Log
- **Documents Assumptions & Constraints** – Captures project-related beliefs and limitations.
- **Tracks Changes Over Time** – Assumptions may evolve as new information becomes available.
- **Supports Risk Management** – Helps identify and assess risks related to incorrect assumptions.
- **Aids Decision-Making** – Provides a reference for project stakeholders when making strategic choices.

## Components of an Assumption Log
- **Assumption Description** – A clear statement of the assumption.
- **Impact on the Project** – How the assumption affects scope, schedule, budget, or risks.
- **Validation Status** – Whether the assumption has been confirmed, remains uncertain, or has changed.
- **Owner** – The individual responsible for monitoring the assumption.
- **Resolution Strategy** – Actions to be taken if the assumption proves incorrect.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
An assumption log records the expectation that a cloud service provider will support a specific API. If the provider discontinues support, the project must find an alternative solution.

### **Construction Project**
A project assumes that material costs will remain stable for the next six months. The assumption log helps track market fluctuations and adjust procurement strategies if needed.

### **Event Planning**
A corporate event assumes a venue will accommodate 500 attendees. If the venue imposes new capacity restrictions, adjustments must be made.

## Why an Assumption Log Matters
- **Enhances Project Predictability** – Provides a structured way to track and review assumptions.
- **Improves Risk Mitigation** – Helps identify potential risks before they become critical issues.
- **Supports Project Governance** – Ensures transparency in decision-making.
