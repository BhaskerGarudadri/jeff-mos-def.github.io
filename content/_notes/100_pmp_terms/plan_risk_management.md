## Process: Plan Risk Management

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Risk Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Plan Risk Management** process involves **defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project**. It establishes the methodology, roles, responsibilities, budget, timing, and categories for managing project risk throughout the lifecycle.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Charter** – Offers high-level information about project objectives, constraints, and stakeholders.
- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the scope, schedule, cost, and stakeholder plans, which influence risk exposure.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Risk attitudes, tolerance levels, industry standards, and regulations.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Risk policies, historical risk data, templates, and lessons learned from similar projects.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Provided by stakeholders, subject matter experts, or consultants experienced in similar projects or industries.
- **Data Analysis** – Includes stakeholder analysis to understand risk tolerance and influence.
- **Meetings** – Used to collaborate on defining risk strategies, planning risk responses, and aligning on key risk categories and roles.

---

## Outputs

- **Risk Management Plan** – A component of the project management plan that outlines:
  - Risk methodology  
  - Roles and responsibilities  
  - Budgeting and timing for risk activities  
  - Risk categories (e.g., via a risk breakdown structure)  
  - Definitions of probability and impact  
  - Probability and impact matrix  
  - Reporting and tracking formats  
  - Risk thresholds  

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Planning Process Group**, Plan Risk Management ensures that **risk efforts are structured, consistent, and scalable** to the project’s complexity.
- Within **Project Risk Management**, it serves as the **foundation for all other risk-related processes**.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Establishes a Risk Framework** – Ensures everyone understands how risks will be approached and managed.
- **Enables Proactive Planning** – Provides structure for identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks early.
- **Improves Consistency** – Applies a common method to risk identification, scoring, and communication.
- **Supports Decision Making** – Helps determine how much effort and resources should be allocated to managing uncertainty.
