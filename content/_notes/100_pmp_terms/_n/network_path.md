A **Network Path** is a **sequence of activities connected by logical relationships** within a project schedule network diagram. Each path represents a **chain of dependent tasks** that must be executed in a specific order, based on defined constraints such as finish-to-start or start-to-start dependencies. The longest of these paths determines the **critical path**, which directly impacts the project’s finish date.

### **Purpose and Characteristics**
- **Defines Activity Flow** – Shows how work progresses from one activity to the next.
- **Built on Dependencies** – Includes logical relationships like FS, SS, FF, and SF.
- **May Contain Float** – Paths not on the critical path have float and are less time-sensitive.
- **Used for Path Analysis** – Helps identify critical, near-critical, and non-critical paths.

### **Example Scenario**
A network path in a product launch project may include:
- Develop prototype → Test prototype → Revise design → Finalize product

If these activities are tightly sequenced, any delay in one affects the rest, making this a candidate for the critical or near-critical path.

### **Mermaid Diagram: Sample Network Path with Dependencies**

    B --> C[Revise Design]
    C --> D[Finalize Product]
```

This diagram represents a linear network path—each task depends on the previous one, forming a continuous chain of execution.

### Why Network Paths Matter

- Enable Critical Path Analysis – Help determine which paths control project duration.
- Guide Scheduling Decisions – Clarify where float exists and where risks are concentrated.
- Support Scenario Planning – Allow visualization of the impact of changes or delays.
