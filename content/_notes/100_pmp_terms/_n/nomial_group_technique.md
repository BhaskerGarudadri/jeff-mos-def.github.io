**Nominal Group Technique (NGT)** is a structured **facilitation method** used for **idea generation, prioritization, and decision-making** in group settings. It encourages balanced participation by ensuring that all voices are heard before a group reaches a consensus.

## Key Aspects of Nominal Group Technique
- **Encourages Equal Participation** – Reduces dominance by louder voices.
- **Combines Individual & Group Input** – Allows independent idea generation before discussion.
- **Uses a Structured Voting Process** – Prioritizes ideas based on collective agreement.
- **Minimizes Bias** – Helps prevent groupthink and undue influence.

## Steps in Nominal Group Technique
1. **Silent Idea Generation** – Participants individually write down ideas.
2. **Round-Robin Sharing** – Each person presents one idea at a time.
3. **Clarification & Discussion** – The group discusses ideas to ensure understanding.
4. **Voting & Prioritization** – Participants rank ideas anonymously or by structured scoring.
5. **Final Decision** – The group selects the highest-priority ideas for action.

## Example Scenarios

### **Project Risk Identification**
A project team uses NGT to brainstorm **potential risks** and **rank them** by likelihood and impact.

### **Product Development**
A company gathers input from stakeholders to **prioritize features** for a new software release.

### **Process Improvement**
An operations team applies NGT to **identify inefficiencies** and determine **which improvements** will have the greatest impact.

## Why Nominal Group Technique Matters
- **Enhances Decision Quality** – Ensures thoughtful, data-driven prioritization.
- **Reduces Conflict** – Provides a structured approach to discussing diverse perspectives.
- **Increases Engagement** – Encourages participation from all team members.
- **Supports Complex Problem-Solving** – Helps manage large amounts of input efficiently.
