## Process: Estimate Activity Resources

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Resource Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Estimate Activity Resources** process involves **estimating the type and quantity of resources**—both human and physical—needed to perform each project activity. It informs schedule development, cost estimation, and procurement planning.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the resource management plan and scope baseline.
- **Project Documents** – Includes activity list, activity attributes, assumption log, cost estimates, and risk register.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Resource availability, team skills, location constraints, labor rates.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Historical data, resource estimation policies, and lessons learned.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to estimate based on experience with similar activities or resource requirements.
- **Bottom-Up Estimating** – Estimates resources at the activity level and aggregates upward.
- **Analogous Estimating** – Uses historical data from similar tasks to estimate resource needs.
- **Parametric Estimating** – Uses statistical relationships (e.g., square footage per labor hour).
- **Data Analysis** – Includes alternatives analysis to compare resource options and trade-offs.
- **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** – Tools that assist with estimating and resource modeling.
- **Meetings** – Planning sessions to validate estimates and review constraints with stakeholders.

---

## Outputs

- **Resource Requirements** – Type and amount of each resource needed per activity, including personnel, equipment, and materials.
- **Basis of Estimates** – Documentation of assumptions, methods, data sources, and confidence levels for each estimate.
- **Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)** – A hierarchical list of resource types by category and function.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to activity attributes, assumption log, and lessons learned register.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- Within the **Planning Process Group**, this process ensures activities are **supported with realistic and feasible resource assumptions**.
- As part of **Project Resource Management**, it informs downstream processes like acquiring resources, estimating duration, and cost planning.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Supports Realistic Scheduling** – Accurate resource estimates help define achievable timelines.
- **Informs Cost Estimating** – Resource usage drives labor and material costs.
- **Improves Planning Accuracy** – Helps avoid over- or under-staffing and resource bottlenecks.
- **Aligns Stakeholder Expectations** – Clarifies what is needed, when, and from whom.
