**Decomposition** is a **technique used to divide and subdivide project scope and deliverables** into **smaller, more manageable parts**. It is commonly used in **scope definition, work breakdown structure (WBS) creation, and schedule development**.

## **Key Aspects of Decomposition**
- **Breaks Down Complex Work** – Converts high-level deliverables into detailed tasks.
- **Enables Better Resource Allocation** – Helps assign responsibilities effectively.
- **Improves Project Planning & Tracking** – Smaller work units enhance control and monitoring.
- **Used in WBS, Schedule, and Cost Estimation** – Essential for structuring project work.

## **Example: Decomposing a Software Project**
| **Level**               | **Component** |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **Project**            | Mobile App Development |
| **Phase**             | Backend Development |
| **Deliverable**       | User Authentication System |
| **Work Package**      | Database Setup |
| **Task**             | Configure User Table in Database |

## **Mermaid Diagram: Decomposition Example (WBS)**

    C --> D["Work Package: Database Setup"]
    D --> E["Task: Configure User Table"]
```

## **Why Decomposition Matters**
- **Enhances Project Clarity** – Helps teams understand project scope and deliverables.
- **Facilitates Task Assignment** – Assigns work at a granular level.
- **Improves Time & Cost Estimation** – Smaller components enable better forecasting.
- **Supports Agile & Waterfall Approaches** – Works well in both structured and iterative planning.
