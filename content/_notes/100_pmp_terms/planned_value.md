# Planned Value (PV)

**Planned Value (PV)** is the **authorized budget assigned to scheduled work** at a specific point in time. It represents how much of the budget should have been spent, according to the project schedule, regardless of actual progress or performance.

PV is a foundational element of **earned value management (EVM)** and is used to evaluate cost and schedule performance.

## Key Characteristics

- **Time-Based Budget Reference** – Tied directly to the schedule  
- **Baseline-Driven** – Calculated from the performance measurement baseline  
- **Excludes Actual Progress** – Independent of work performed or cost incurred  
- **Used in Variance Calculations** – Compared with EV and AC for performance insight

## Example Scenarios

- By week 6, a project is planned to have completed $200,000 worth of work—this is its PV  
- A monthly PV curve helps track budgeted progress against actual performance  
- PV is used to determine if the project is on pace financially and temporally

## Why Planned Value Matters

- **Establishes a Baseline** – Sets the reference for comparing actual and earned value  
- **Supports Performance Metrics** – Enables calculation of schedule variance and SPI  
- **Improves Forecasting** – Allows early detection of slippage or overrun  
- **Drives Cost Control** – Informs decision-making around resource use and pacing
