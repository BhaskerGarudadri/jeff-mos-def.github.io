A **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate** is an initial estimate of the cost of a project or parts of a project, with a rough accuracy range. This estimate provides stakeholders and decision makers with a general idea of the project cost’s order of magnitude.

The ROM estimate is refined over time as more information becomes available during the project, following the concept of progressive elaboration.

## Key Characteristics

- **Early-Stage Estimate** – Typically developed during initiation or conceptual planning  
- **Low Accuracy** – May have a range of –25% to +75% depending on project context  
- **Supports Feasibility Decisions** – Used to evaluate whether to pursue, fund, or prioritize efforts  
- **Subject to Revision** – Becomes more precise as scope and requirements are clarified  

## Example Scenarios

- Estimating $2 million ±75% for a capital project based on a high-level scope  
- Providing a cost range for proposal evaluation in portfolio selection  
- Using historical data to forecast rough costs for a new initiative  

## Role in Cost and Scope Planning

- **Enables Early Decision-Making** – Provides directional insight before detailed planning  
- **Supports Progressive Elaboration** – Refined into more accurate estimates over time  
- **Establishes Initial Baselines** – Forms a starting point for cost evaluation and adjustment  
- **Informs Stakeholder Expectations** – Communicates uncertainty while enabling planning
