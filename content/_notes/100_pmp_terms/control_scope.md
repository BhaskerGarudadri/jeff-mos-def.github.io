## Process: Control Scope

**Process Group**: Monitoring and Controlling  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Scope Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Control Scope** process involves **monitoring the status of the project and product scope** and managing changes to the scope baseline. It ensures that **only approved changes are implemented** and helps prevent scope creep by **identifying deviations early** and initiating corrective actions.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the scope management plan, scope baseline, and change management plan.
- **Project Documents** – Includes lessons learned register, requirements documentation, and traceability matrix.
- **Work Performance Data** – Information on scope-related task status and completed deliverables.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Historical data, change control procedures, and scope control policies.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Data Analysis**  
  - *Variance Analysis* – Compares planned vs. actual performance to detect scope deviations.
  - *Trend Analysis* – Monitors evolving scope issues over time.
  
- **Expert Judgment** – Used to interpret scope data and recommend corrective actions.
- **Meetings** – Held to assess scope changes, review status, and communicate actions to stakeholders.

---

## Outputs

- **Work Performance Information** – Aggregated data showing how scope is performing relative to the plan.
- **Change Requests** – Triggered when deviations require updates to scope, deliverables, or documentation.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Especially to the scope baseline, if change requests are approved.
- **Project Document Updates** – Including the requirements documentation and traceability matrix.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Monitoring and Controlling Process Group**, Control Scope ensures **project work stays aligned with approved scope boundaries**.
- Within **Project Scope Management**, it reinforces the structure needed to detect and address scope issues **before they impact schedule, cost, or quality**.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Ensures that work performed aligns with authorized requirements only.
- **Maintains Control** – Allows timely intervention to resolve unauthorized changes or misunderstandings.
- **Enables Transparent Change Management** – Integrates tightly with Perform Integrated Change Control.
- **Supports Predictable Performance** – Keeps the project focused on delivering what was promised.
