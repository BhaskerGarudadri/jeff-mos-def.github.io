## Process: Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Risk Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis** process uses **numerical techniques to evaluate the overall project risk and quantify the impact of individual risks** on project objectives. It supports decision-making by modeling risk interactions and providing **probabilistic estimates of outcomes** like cost and schedule.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the risk management, cost, and schedule baselines.
- **Project Documents** – Includes the risk register, risk report, cost estimates, schedule forecasts, and resource requirements.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Risk databases, simulation tools, and industry benchmarks.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Templates, models, and data from similar past projects.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to define model assumptions and validate the analysis approach.
- **Data Gathering** – Interviews or historical data used to establish probability distributions.
- **Interpersonal and Team Skills** – Facilitation to ensure consistent input from stakeholders and subject matter experts.

- **Representations of Uncertainty** – Probability distributions (e.g., normal, triangular, beta) for cost and duration inputs.
- **Data Analysis**  
  - *Monte Carlo simulation* – Models combined uncertainty across multiple variables.  
  - *Sensitivity analysis* – Identifies which risks have the most significant impact.  
  - *Decision tree analysis* – Evaluates expected monetary value (EMV) of decision options.  
  - *Influence diagrams* – Visual models of relationships among project variables.

## Outputs

- **Updated Risk Report** – Includes:
  - Probabilistic estimates of project duration and cost  
  - Probability of meeting specific objectives  
  - Contingency reserve recommendations  
  - Key drivers of risk exposure  

- **Project Document Updates** – Enhancements to the risk register, assumptions log, and lessons learned register.

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- Within the **Planning Process Group**, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis provides **evidence-based insight** into how risks affect objectives.
- In **Project Risk Management**, it supports **realistic planning, reserve allocation, and decision support** through detailed modeling.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Increases Forecast Accuracy** – Replaces guesswork with statistically valid projections.
- **Prioritizes Risk Drivers** – Helps target mitigation efforts to where they will be most effective.
- **Supports Strategic Decisions** – Equips leadership with objective data to approve funding, contingencies, or go/no-go choices.
- **Complements Qualitative Analysis** – Deepens understanding of high-priority risks by quantifying their impact.
