**Earned Value (EV)** is the **measure of work performed** in a project, expressed in terms of the **budget authorized for that work**. It is a key component of **Earned Value Management (EVM)** and is used to track **project performance and progress**.

## **Key Aspects of Earned Value**
- **Represents Completed Work Value** – Expresses progress in monetary terms.
- **Used in Performance Measurement** – Compared against Planned Value (PV) and Actual Cost (AC).
- **Helps Forecast Future Performance** – Forms the basis for cost and schedule variance analysis.
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Provides insight into whether the project is ahead, on track, or behind.

## **Earned Value Formula**
$$
EV = \text{% of Work Completed} \times \text{Budget at Completion (BAC)}
$$
Where:
- **EV** = Earned Value
- **BAC** = Total authorized budget for the project
- **% of Work Completed** = Verified project progress in percentage

## **Example Calculation**
A project has a **Budget at Completion (BAC) of \$500,000**, and the team has completed **40% of the total work**.

$$
EV = 40\% \times 500,000 = 200,000
$$

Thus, the **Earned Value (EV) is \$200,000**, meaning that work worth **\$200,000 of the total budgeted cost** has been completed.

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A **development team** working on a **\$1 million project** has **completed 50% of the work**.  
**Earned Value = \$500,000**, indicating **half the authorized budgeted work is done**.

### **Construction Project**
A **building project** with a **BAC of \$2 million** has **completed 30% of planned tasks**.  
**Earned Value = \$600,000**, helping managers assess progress against planned cost.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A **marketing team** with a **\$100,000 budget** has **executed 25% of planned strategies**.  
**Earned Value = \$25,000**, used to track campaign efficiency.

## **Why Earned Value Matters**
- **Provides Objective Project Performance Metrics** – Eliminates reliance on subjective status updates.
- **Identifies Cost & Schedule Variances** – Helps track project health.
- **Improves Forecasting Accuracy** – Supports Estimate at Completion (EAC) analysis.
- **Supports Proactive Decision-Making** – Enables early intervention for cost overruns.
