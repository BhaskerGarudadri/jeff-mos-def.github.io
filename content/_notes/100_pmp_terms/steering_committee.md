A **Steering Committee** is an advisory body of senior stakeholders who provide direction and support for the portfolio, program, or project team and make decisions outside of the team’s authority.

It ensures strategic alignment, resolves escalated issues, and provides oversight for progress, scope, budget, and risk decisions that require executive-level input.

## Key Characteristics

- **Strategic Decision-Making** – Focused on high-level guidance and approvals  
- **Not Operational** – Does not manage day-to-day activities  
- **Supports the Team** – Helps resolve barriers and secure organizational buy-in  

## Example Scenarios

- Approving major scope changes or funding reallocations  
- Resolving cross-departmental conflicts that affect delivery  
- Validating that the project remains aligned with business goals  

## Role in Governance and Oversight

- **Strengthens Organizational Alignment** – Ensures the initiative supports enterprise objectives  
- **Provides Escalation Path** – Handles decisions beyond project authority  
- **Increases Accountability** – Offers external oversight and performance review  
- **Drives Strategic Support** – Advocates for the project across the enterprise
