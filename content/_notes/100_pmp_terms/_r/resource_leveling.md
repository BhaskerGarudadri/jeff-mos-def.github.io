**Resource Leveling** is a resource optimization technique in which adjustments are made to the project schedule to optimize the allocation of resources and which may affect the critical path.

It resolves overallocation or resource conflicts by delaying or extending activities, ensuring that resources are used efficiently without exceeding availability limits.

## Key Characteristics

- **Schedule-Driven** – May change activity start and end dates  
- **May Impact Critical Path** – Can extend overall project duration  
- **Balances Workload** – Eliminates peaks and valleys in resource usage  
- **Constraint-Aware** – Considers resource limits, not just task logic  

## Example Scenarios

- Shifting tasks to accommodate a shared resource with limited availability  
- Adjusting start dates of overlapping activities using the same personnel  
- Delaying non-critical tasks to free up overallocated equipment  

## Role in Project Scheduling

- **Enhances Feasibility** – Aligns the schedule with actual resource capacity  
- **Supports Sustainable Execution** – Prevents burnout and overcommitment  
- **Reduces Risk** – Minimizes scheduling issues caused by unrealistic resource demands  
- **Complements Other Techniques** – Used alongside resource smoothing and optimization
