A **Requirements Management Plan** is a component of the program or project management plan that describes how requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed.

It outlines the processes, tools, and methodologies used to ensure that requirements are effectively captured, traced, maintained, and validated throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Characteristics

- **Defines Process Ownership** – Identifies who is responsible for managing requirements  
- **Establishes Traceability** – Ensures requirements can be linked back to business objectives  
- **Specifies Tools and Formats** – Details how requirements will be recorded and maintained  
- **Supports Change Control** – Includes procedures for managing requirement changes  

## Example Scenarios

- Using a traceability matrix to monitor requirement coverage throughout development  
- Documenting the approval process for modifying scope-related requirements  
- Defining how requirement changes are submitted, reviewed, and approved  

## Role in Project Planning

- **Promotes Consistency** – Standardizes how requirements are handled across teams  
- **Improves Communication** – Provides a shared framework for understanding requirements  
- **Controls Scope Creep** – Enables structured evaluation of proposed changes  
- **Ensures Quality Delivery** – Supports alignment between stakeholder needs and final outputs
