**Risk Assessment** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and determining the probability of occurrence of a risk and its impacts if it does occur.

It establishes a foundation for prioritizing risks and selecting appropriate response strategies by evaluating both the likelihood and potential consequences of each identified risk.

## Key Characteristics

- **Systematic Process** – Follows structured steps of identification and analysis  
- **Probability and Impact Focused** – Measures risk severity based on likelihood and consequences  
- **Feeds Risk Planning** – Drives response selection and resource allocation  
- **Supports Ongoing Monitoring** – Establishes baseline understanding for future reviews  

## Example Scenarios

- Analyzing potential cost overruns due to supply chain disruption  
- Estimating the likelihood and impact of system downtime during deployment  
- Categorizing risks using a probability and impact matrix  

## Role in Risk Management

- **Drives Prioritization** – Identifies which risks require immediate attention  
- **Improves Response Effectiveness** – Ensures actions are tailored to actual exposure  
- **Enables Informed Decisions** – Supports trade-offs between risk and opportunity  
- **Strengthens Risk Register Quality** – Enhances accuracy and relevance of risk data
