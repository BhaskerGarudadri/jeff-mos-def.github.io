A **Readiness Assessment** is an assessment that occurs as the organization approaches solution deployment. It helps the organization understand the extent to which the organization is prepared for the transition and evaluates the organization’s readiness to integrate and sustain the solution.

It identifies potential gaps, barriers, and enablers that may affect adoption, and informs planning to ensure a smooth transition.

## Key Characteristics

- **Timing Before Deployment** – Conducted in the lead-up to implementation  
- **Evaluates Preparedness** – Measures organizational capacity to adopt the solution  
- **Identifies Risks** – Highlights readiness gaps that could hinder integration  
- **Supports Transition Planning** – Enables mitigation strategies to smooth rollout  

## Example Scenarios

- Assessing staff training levels and support readiness before launching a new software platform  
- Evaluating leadership alignment and communication structures prior to a process overhaul  
- Reviewing infrastructure and resource availability before deploying a new product line  

## Role in Change Management

- **Supports Risk Management** – Uncovers readiness risks that impact deployment success  
- **Enables Proactive Planning** – Drives creation of targeted action plans for transition gaps  
- **Increases Adoption Likelihood** – Ensures organizational buy-in and preparedness  
- **Strengthens Sustainability** – Confirms post-deployment structures are in place for long-term support
