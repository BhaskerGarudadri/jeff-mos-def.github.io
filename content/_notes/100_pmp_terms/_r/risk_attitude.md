**Risk Attitude** is a disposition toward uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior.

It influences how risks are perceived, assessed, and responded to, shaping decisions and actions throughout the project or organizational context.
