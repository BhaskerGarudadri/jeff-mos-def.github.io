**Relative Estimating** is a method for creating estimates that are derived from performing a comparison against a similar body of work, taking effort, complexity, and uncertainty into consideration.

Rather than assigning absolute values, this method evaluates work items in relation to one another, enabling faster estimation and improved consistency across teams.

## Key Characteristics

- **Comparative Approach** – Estimates are based on how work items relate in size or complexity  
- **Fast and Collaborative** – Encourages group consensus without requiring detailed data  
- **Useful in Uncertainty** – Ideal when exact information is limited  
- **Common in Agile** – Often applied using story points, t-shirt sizing, or affinity mapping  

## Example Scenarios

- Comparing user stories in backlog grooming sessions to assign story points  
- Using previous sprint tasks to estimate similar new tasks  
- Estimating feature complexity using team consensus with t-shirt sizes

## Example Relative Estimating Comparison Table

| Task           | Story Points | Relative Effort | Complexity | Uncertainty |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| Task A         | 2            | Low              | Low        | Low         |
| Task B         | 2            | Low              | Low        | Low         |
| Task C         | 5            | Medium           | Medium     | Medium      |
| Task D         | 8            | High             | High       | High        |

## Role in Planning

- **Speeds Up Estimation** – Reduces time spent on exhaustive analysis  
- **Improves Team Alignment** – Builds shared understanding of work scope  
- **Adapts to Uncertainty** – Handles ambiguity without sacrificing planning integrity  
- **Supports Incremental Delivery** – Enables consistent velocity tracking
