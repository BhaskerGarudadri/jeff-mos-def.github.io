A **Risk Action** is a detailed task that implements, in whole or in part, a response strategy in order to address an individual risk or overall risk.

It operationalizes the chosen risk response by specifying who will do what, when, and how, ensuring that the strategy is executed effectively and integrated into project activities.

## Key Characteristics

- **Tactical and Specific** – Breaks down the response strategy into actionable steps  
- **Aligned to Strategy** – Directly supports avoidance, mitigation, transfer, exploitation, or other strategies  
- **Assigned and Tracked** – Delegated to resources and monitored for execution  
- **Tied to Risk Register** – Documented and managed as part of the overall risk response plan  

## Example Scenarios

- Creating a backup power system to mitigate risk of power loss  
- Contracting with a third party to transfer financial liability  
- Scheduling training sessions to reduce the risk of user error during deployment  

## Role in Risk Management

- **Drives Execution** – Turns strategy into concrete action  
- **Enables Accountability** – Ensures responsibility for managing risk is assigned  
- **Improves Monitoring** – Allows tracking of response progress and effectiveness  
- **Supports Documentation** – Formalizes the link between risk plans and project implementation
