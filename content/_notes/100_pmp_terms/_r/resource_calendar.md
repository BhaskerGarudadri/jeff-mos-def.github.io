A **Resource Calendar** is a calendar that identifies the working days and shifts during which each specific resource is available.

It defines the availability of personnel, equipment, and other resources, enabling accurate scheduling, coordination, and allocation across project activities.

## Key Characteristics

- **Resource-Specific** – Tailored to each resource’s availability and work schedule  
- **Includes Non-Working Time** – Accounts for holidays, time off, and maintenance windows  
- **Supports Schedule Development** – Informs when resources can realistically be assigned  
- **Dynamic and Updatable** – Reflects changes in availability throughout the project  

## Example Scenarios

- Scheduling tasks based on team members' individual time-off calendars  
- Coordinating equipment use across shifts to avoid conflicts  
- Adjusting resource plans based on updated availability due to leave or reassignment  

## Role in Scheduling and Planning

- **Improves Accuracy** – Aligns activity timelines with real-world availability  
- **Reduces Conflicts** – Helps prevent overallocation or scheduling overlaps  
- **Enables Realistic Forecasting** – Supports achievable workload planning  
- **Supports Risk Mitigation** – Identifies gaps or delays due to unavailability
