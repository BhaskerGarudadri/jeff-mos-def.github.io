A **Release** is one or more components of one or more products, which are intended to be put into production at the same time.

It represents a coordinated deployment of deliverables and is structured to ensure functionality, compatibility, and value delivery as part of a planned rollout.

## Key Characteristics

- **Grouped Deployment** – Combines multiple components or products into a single launch  
- **Planned and Controlled** – Managed through release planning and change control processes  
- **Aligned to Value Delivery** – Designed to deliver usable outcomes to the customer or end user  
- **May Contain Interim or Final Outputs** – Can include partial features or complete solutions  

## Example Scenarios

- Releasing a set of new application features as part of a monthly software update  
- Deploying a hardware component alongside its firmware and documentation  
- Launching an integrated solution composed of backend services, UI changes, and reporting tools  

## Role in Implementation

- **Supports Incremental Delivery** – Enables phased introduction of capabilities  
- **Facilitates Integration** – Ensures all components function together as expected  
- **Coordinates Stakeholders** – Aligns development, testing, and operations for go-live  
- **Manages Risk** – Consolidates changes to reduce disruption and improve stability
