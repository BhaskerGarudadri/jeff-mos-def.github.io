**Risk Identification** is the process of locating and profiling the characteristics of risks related to work objectives.

It systematically uncovers threats and opportunities that may affect project performance, establishing the foundation for all subsequent risk management activities.

## Key Characteristics

- **Early and Iterative** – Conducted throughout the project lifecycle  
- **Objective-Driven** – Focuses on risks that could impact scope, time, cost, or quality  
- **Collaborative Process** – Involves input from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and team members  
- **Supports Documentation** – Populates the risk register with structured, categorized entries  

## Example Scenarios

- Conducting brainstorming sessions during project planning to identify technical risks  
- Using checklists or historical data to uncover typical risks in similar projects  
- Reviewing stakeholder concerns to capture potential external threats  

## Role in Risk Management

- **Initiates Risk Analysis** – Provides the input for assessment and prioritization  
- **Enables Proactive Planning** – Identifies risks before they affect performance  
- **Strengthens Communication** – Aligns team understanding of known and emerging risks  
- **Feeds Risk Register** – Documents each identified risk with relevant attributes
