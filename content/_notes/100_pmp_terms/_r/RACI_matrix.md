A **RACI Matrix** is a type of **responsibility assignment matrix** that uses the statuses **responsible**, **accountable**, **consulted**, and **informed** to define the involvement of stakeholders in project activities. It explicitly assigns roles, ensuring each stakeholder clearly understands their level of participation and accountability.

The RACI matrix reduces ambiguity, enhances clarity, and promotes effective stakeholder engagement.

## Key Characteristics

- **Responsible** – The individual(s) performing the task or activity  
- **Accountable** – The individual ultimately answerable for task completion and outcome  
- **Consulted** – Stakeholders whose expertise or opinions are sought  
- **Informed** – Stakeholders who need regular updates but do not directly engage in task execution  

## Example Scenarios

- Determining who is accountable for approving final deliverables  
- Identifying subject matter experts who must be consulted during requirements analysis  
- Clarifying who should receive project status updates  

## Example RACI Chart

| Activity             | Project Manager | Team Lead | Business Analyst | Sponsor |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Define Requirements  | A               | R         | C                | I       |
| Develop Schedule     | A               | R         | C                | I       |
| Approve Budget       | C               | C         | I                | A       |
| Execute Tasks        | R               | A         | I                | I       |
| Monitor Progress     | A               | C         | R                | I       |

## Role in Stakeholder Management

- **Clarifies Roles** – Clearly defines expectations for stakeholder engagement  
- **Enhances Communication** – Specifies who needs information and when  
- **Reduces Overlap** – Clearly differentiates accountability and responsibility  
- **Improves Governance** – Identifies clear pathways for decision-making and approvals
