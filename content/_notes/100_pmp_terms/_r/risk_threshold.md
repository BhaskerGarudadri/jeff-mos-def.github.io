**Risk Threshold** is the measure of acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the risk appetite of the organization and stakeholders.

It defines the specific limits of risk tolerance and serves as a boundary that, when crossed, triggers action, escalation, or reevaluation of plans to ensure alignment with risk attitudes and objectives.

## Key Characteristics

- **Quantifiable Limit** – Expressed in terms such as cost, time, or performance deviation  
- **Aligned With Risk Appetite** – Converts general appetite into actionable boundaries  
- **Triggers Action** – Breaching a threshold requires a predefined response  
- **Stakeholder-Driven** – Determined based on stakeholder expectations and acceptance  

## Example Scenarios

- Defining a ±5% budget variance as the acceptable cost risk threshold  
- Setting a two-week maximum delay window for critical milestones  
- Establishing a service quality threshold to ensure customer satisfaction remains above target  

## Role in Risk Governance

- **Supports Consistent Decision-Making** – Ensures responses are aligned with tolerances  
- **Improves Transparency** – Clearly defines when and why action is required  
- **Enables Escalation Protocols** – Facilitates timely response to unacceptable risks  
- **Reinforces Risk Strategy** – Helps tailor actions based on organizational tolerance levels
