**Risk Exposure** is an aggregate measure of the potential impact of all risks at any given point in time in a portfolio, program, or project.

It combines the probability and consequences of identified risks into a single value or risk profile, providing insight into the overall level of uncertainty and potential deviation from objectives.

## Key Characteristics

- **Cumulative Measure** – Reflects the totality of risk, not individual items  
- **Dynamic and Time-Based** – Changes as risks are identified, updated, or resolved  
- **Supports Risk-Informed Decisions** – Enables prioritization of resources and attention  
- **Can Be Quantified** – Often expressed in monetary or schedule impact terms  

## Example Scenarios

- Calculating total cost exposure based on the expected monetary value of all active risks  
- Reassessing risk exposure at phase gates to determine readiness to proceed  
- Monitoring changes in exposure as risk responses are implemented and new risks emerge  

## Role in Risk Monitoring and Control

- **Informs Stakeholder Communication** – Provides a snapshot of overall project risk health  
- **Supports Forecasting** – Anticipates potential deviations from baselines  
- **Enables Threshold Management** – Triggers action when exposure exceeds tolerances  
- **Guides Contingency Planning** – Justifies reserve levels and escalation paths
