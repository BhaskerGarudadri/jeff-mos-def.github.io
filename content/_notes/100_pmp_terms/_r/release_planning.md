**Release Planning** is the process of identifying a high-level plan for releasing or transitioning a product, deliverable, or increment of value.

It defines the timing, scope, and sequencing of releases, ensuring alignment with business objectives and coordination across teams and stakeholders.

- **Value-Centric** – Organizes releases around the delivery of usable functionality  
- **Cross-Functional** – Involves collaboration between product, technical, and business roles  
- **Guides Iteration Planning** – Informs detailed work breakdowns and sprint commitments  

## Example Scenarios

- Planning phased releases of a mobile app across platforms  
- Mapping feature delivery timelines across multiple teams in a scaled environment  
- Coordinating technical readiness, training, and communications for deployment  

## Role in Product Delivery
