**Risk Exploiting** is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to ensure that an opportunity occurs.

It involves taking deliberate action to capture a positive risk by guaranteeing its realization, typically applied to opportunities with high potential benefit that align directly with project objectives.

## Key Characteristics

- **Maximization Strategy** – Focuses on securing the full value of a favorable event  
- **Proactive and Decisive** – Requires intentional effort to make the opportunity happen  
- **Opportunity-Specific** – Applied to desirable, high-impact opportunities  
- **Resource-Intensive** – May require investment or adjustment to project plans  

## Example Scenarios

- Assigning the best resources to a task to ensure exceptional early delivery  
- Partnering exclusively with a high-performing vendor to secure premium service  
- Adjusting project scope to fully integrate a newly identified business opportunity  

## Role in Opportunity Management

- **Drives Strategic Value** – Ensures the project benefits from favorable conditions  
- **Aligns With Objectives** – Pursues opportunities that support key goals  
- **Requires Ownership and Action** – Assigns responsibility to implement the opportunity  
- **Distinguished from Enhancement** – Focuses on certainty of occurrence rather than probability increase
