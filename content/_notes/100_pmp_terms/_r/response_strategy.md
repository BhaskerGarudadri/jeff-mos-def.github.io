A **Response Strategy** is a high-level approach to address an individual risk or overall risk, broken down into a set of risk actions.

It provides a structured plan for how threats or opportunities will be handled, aligning specific risk responses with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

## Key Characteristics

- **Strategy-Driven** – Guides the selection of specific risk actions  
- **Tailored by Risk Type** – Separate strategies exist for threats and opportunities  
- **Proactive and Reactive** – Can be applied in advance or in response to emerging risks  
- **Part of the Risk Response Plan** – Informs and organizes tactical execution  

## Example Scenarios

- Choosing an avoidance strategy to eliminate a risk by changing the project scope  
- Selecting an exploitation strategy to maximize a time-saving opportunity  
- Implementing a transfer strategy by purchasing insurance for a high-cost threat  

## Role in Risk Management

- **Aligns Actions with Objectives** – Ensures responses support broader project goals  
- **Improves Planning Coherence** – Structures how risk actions are prioritized and executed  
- **Supports Communication** – Clarifies intent behind response decisions for stakeholders  
- **Feeds Into Monitoring and Control** – Enables performance tracking of risk handling
