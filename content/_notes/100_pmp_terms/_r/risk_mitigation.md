**Risk Mitigation** is a risk response strategy that involves decreasing the probability of occurrence or impact of a threat.

It focuses on implementing actions that reduce the likelihood that a risk event will happen or lessen its effect if it does, helping to protect project objectives and maintain performance within acceptable thresholds.

## Key Characteristics

- **Threat-Focused** – Applied specifically to negative risks  
- **Reduces Probability or Impact** – May address one or both dimensions  
- **Proactive Strategy** – Implemented in advance to reduce exposure  
- **Requires Ongoing Monitoring** – Effectiveness is reviewed and adjusted over time  

## Example Scenarios

- Adding quality assurance checkpoints to reduce the chance of product defects  
- Scheduling tasks with buffer time to minimize the impact of potential delays  
- Training team members to lower the risk of user error during critical phases  

## Role in Risk Response Planning

- **Strengthens Project Stability** – Reduces the chance of disruptive events  
- **Improves Confidence** – Provides stakeholders with assurance that risks are managed  
- **Supports Resource Allocation** – Justifies investments in risk-reducing actions  
- **Feeds into Reserve Planning** – Works alongside contingency reserves for residual risks
