**Schedule Compression** is a technique used to shorten the schedule duration without reducing the project scope.

It is applied to meet project deadlines, recover from delays, or align with external time constraints, using methods that accelerate work while maintaining full delivery of scope and quality.

## Key Characteristics

- **Scope-Preserving** – Reduces time without eliminating deliverables  
- **Uses Specific Techniques** – Typically includes crashing or fast tracking  
- **Impacts Cost or Risk** – Often increases cost or risk exposure  
- **Requires Careful Planning** – Must ensure feasibility and resource availability  

## Example Scenarios

- Adding additional resources to critical path activities (crashing)  
- Performing design and development work in parallel (fast tracking)  
- Shortening task durations by reworking dependencies or optimizing effort  

## Role in Schedule Management

- **Supports Deadline Alignment** – Helps meet fixed delivery dates  
- **Enables Recovery** – Recaptures lost time due to earlier schedule slippage  
- **Informs Trade-Off Decisions** – Balances cost, risk, and timeline  
- **Used in Replanning** – Integrated during change control or schedule rebaselining
