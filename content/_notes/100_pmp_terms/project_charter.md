The **Project Charter** is a **document issued by the project initiator or sponsor** that formally **authorizes the existence of a project** and provides the **project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities**. It establishes the project’s legitimacy, identifies the project manager, and links the project to strategic objectives.

This document serves as the foundation for project planning and execution.

## Key Characteristics

- **Formal Authorization** – Confirms the project’s official launch  
- **Establishes Authority** – Names the project manager and their delegated power  
- **Strategic Alignment** – Connects the project to broader organizational goals  
- **Foundation for Planning** – Precedes and enables the development of the project management plan

## Example Scenarios

- A sponsor signs a charter to initiate a product development project  
- The charter grants the project manager access to cross-departmental resources  
- An external client’s approval of a project charter triggers internal planning activities

## Role in Project Initiation

- **Provides Clear Direction** – Sets scope, objectives, and high-level requirements  
- **Enables Resource Allocation** – Grants authority to acquire and assign assets  
- **Aligns Stakeholders** – Establishes shared understanding of project purpose  
- **Supports Governance** – Serves as the reference point for oversight and escalation
