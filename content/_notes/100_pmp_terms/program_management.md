**Program Management** is the **application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program** in order to **achieve the program objectives** and gain **benefits and control not available by managing program components individually**. It focuses on aligning multiple related projects, sub-programs, and activities under a unified structure to deliver strategic outcomes.

Program management bridges tactical execution and strategic intent, ensuring coordinated planning, resource optimization, and risk governance across the program.
