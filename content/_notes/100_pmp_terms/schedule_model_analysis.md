**Schedule Model Analysis** is a process used to investigate or analyze the output of the schedule model in order to optimize the schedule.

It involves reviewing calculated start and finish dates, float, critical path, dependencies, and constraints to evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, and risk exposure of the planned schedule, and to identify opportunities for improvement.

## Key Characteristics

- **Diagnostic and Evaluative** – Assesses schedule quality and performance  
- **Supports Optimization** – Enables adjustments to sequencing, durations, or resources  
- **Highlights Risk Areas** – Identifies scheduling bottlenecks, conflicts, and delays  
- **Relies on Tools and Techniques** – May use critical path method, schedule compression, or what-if analysis  

## Example Scenarios

- Analyzing total float to identify high-risk tasks that need closer tracking  
- Running a what-if analysis to evaluate the impact of shifting milestones  
- Reviewing the critical path to determine where schedule compression is possible  

## Role in Project Scheduling and Control

- **Improves Schedule Accuracy** – Ensures the model reflects realistic execution  
- **Supports Informed Decisions** – Guides selection of mitigation or acceleration strategies  
- **Enhances Risk Management** – Highlights schedule vulnerabilities and exposures  
- **Feeds Into Schedule Forecasting** – Informs projections and corrective actions
