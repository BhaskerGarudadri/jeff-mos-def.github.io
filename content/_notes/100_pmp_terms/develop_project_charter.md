## Process: Develop Project Charter

**Process Group**: Initiating  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Integration Management  

---

## Purpose

The Develop Project Charter process formally authorizes the existence of a project. It gives the project manager the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities and establishes a direct link between the project and strategic objectives.

---

## Inputs

- **Business Case** – Justifies the need for the project and outlines expected benefits.
- **Benefits Management Plan** – Defines how and when the project's benefits will be delivered.
- **Agreements** – Formal or informal agreements such as contracts or MOUs that influence project scope or commitment.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Conditions not under the control of the team that influence the charter, such as regulatory requirements or organizational culture.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Policies, procedures, historical information, and templates relevant to charter development.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Insight from experienced individuals or groups.
- **Data Gathering** – Brainstorming, interviews, and focus groups to capture expectations, risks, and high-level scope.
- **Interpersonal and Team Skills** – Conflict resolution, facilitation, and meeting management to ensure alignment.
- **Meetings** – Structured discussions with stakeholders to define objectives, constraints, and success criteria.

---

## Outputs

- **Project Charter** – A document that includes:
  - Project purpose and justification  
  - Measurable objectives and success criteria  
  - High-level requirements  
  - Summary milestone schedule  
  - Pre-approved budget or financial resources  
  - List of key stakeholders  
  - Assigned project manager and their authority level  
  - Project approval requirements  
  - Assumptions and constraints  
  - High-level risks

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Initiating Process Group**, this process is the first formal step in starting a new project or phase.
- Within **Project Integration Management**, it represents the first act of integrating inputs and expectations into a unified, authorized start point for the project.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Authorizes the Project** – Grants legitimacy and access to resources.
- **Establishes Boundaries** – Defines what the project is and is not.
- **Aligns Stakeholders** – Ensures everyone begins with a shared understanding of objectives, roles, and authority.
