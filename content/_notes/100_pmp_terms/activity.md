An **[[activity]]** is a distinct, scheduled portion of work performed during the course of a project. Activities represent the tasks necessary to complete project deliverables and are fundamental to project scheduling and execution.

## Key Aspects of an Activity
- **Defined Scope** – Each activity has a clear objective and expected outcome.
- **Time-Bound** – Scheduled with a start and finish date.
- **Resource-Driven** – Requires assigned resources (people, equipment, or materials).
- **Sequenced** – Often dependent on other activities within a project schedule.

## Types of Activities
- **Discrete Activities** – Produce tangible results, such as coding a feature or writing a report.
- **Level of Effort (LoE) Activities** – Support work, such as project oversight or maintenance.
- **Apportioned Effort** – Work distributed across other activities, like quality assurance reviews.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development Project**
- *Activity:* Develop login authentication module.
- *Dependencies:* Cannot start until the database schema is finalized.
- *Duration:* Estimated at two weeks.

### **Construction Project**
- *Activity:* Pour foundation concrete.
- *Dependencies:* Requires site preparation and permit approval.
- *Resources:* Construction crew, concrete mix, and machinery.

## Why Activities Matter
- **Enable Scheduling & Tracking** – Provide a basis for timeline estimation and project monitoring.
- **Improve Resource Management** – Help allocate manpower, tools, and budget effectively.
- **Facilitate Dependency Management** – Ensure logical sequencing and prevent delays.
