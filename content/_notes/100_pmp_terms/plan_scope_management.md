## Process: Plan Scope Management

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Scope Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Plan Scope Management** process defines **how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled**. It produces the Scope Management Plan and Requirements Management Plan, which set the **framework for managing project and product scope** throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Charter** – Provides high-level scope, objectives, and project context.
- **Project Management Plan** – Particularly the quality management, lifecycle, and development approach sections.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Such as organizational culture, infrastructure, and marketplace conditions.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Includes policies, procedures, templates, and historical scope-related information.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – From individuals with experience in scope planning and requirements definition.
- **Data Analysis** – Includes alternatives analysis to evaluate scope approaches.
- **Meetings** – Planning sessions with key stakeholders to align expectations, define control processes, and clarify roles.

---

## Outputs

- **Scope Management Plan** – Describes how scope will be defined, validated, and controlled, including:
  - Process for preparing a detailed scope statement  
  - Process for managing scope changes  
  - Approach for preventing scope creep  
  - Integration with other planning documents  

- **Requirements Management Plan** – Describes how requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed, including:
  - Requirements prioritization and traceability  
  - Metrics for tracking quality and completeness  
  - Roles and responsibilities in requirements collection and approval  

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Planning Process Group**, this process sets the **strategic foundation for scope-related activities**.
- Within **Project Scope Management**, it ensures that all other scope processes (Define Scope, Collect Requirements, etc.) follow a structured, repeatable process.
