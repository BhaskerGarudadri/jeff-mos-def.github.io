**Analogous Estimating** is a technique used to estimate the duration, cost, or resource requirements for a project or activity based on historical data from similar past projects. It is a high-level estimating method often used when detailed project information is limited.

## Key Aspects of Analogous Estimating
- **Uses Historical Data** – Relies on past project experiences to predict outcomes.
- **Quick and Cost-Effective** – Requires minimal effort compared to detailed estimation techniques.
- **Less Accurate than Other Methods** – Provides broad estimates that may need refinement.
- **Best for Early Planning Phases** – Helps establish initial budget and schedule baselines.

## When to Use Analogous Estimating
- **Limited Project Data** – When there is not enough detailed information for bottom-up estimating.
- **High-Level Budgeting and Scheduling** – For creating rough estimates before detailed planning.
- **Early Feasibility Studies** – When evaluating project viability with limited resources.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A company developing a new mobile app estimates its cost based on a similar app built last year. If the previous app took six months and cost $500,000, the new app is estimated to require the same timeline and budget.

### **Construction Project**
A construction firm planning a new office building estimates its cost based on a similar project completed two years ago, adjusting for inflation and material costs.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A marketing team estimates the cost of a new product launch campaign by referencing the budget and timeline of a past successful campaign with a similar scope.

## Why Analogous Estimating Matters
- **Speeds Up Decision-Making** – Allows project teams to develop estimates without extensive analysis.
- **Provides a Baseline for Further Refinement** – Can be adjusted with more precise techniques later.
- **Reduces Planning Effort** – Helps estimate costs and timelines efficiently in the early stages.
