## Process: Estimate Activity Durations

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Schedule Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Estimate Activity Durations** process involves **approximating the number of work periods** required to complete each activity, considering the **resource types, quantities, productivity levels, and known constraints**. This process provides the foundation for developing a realistic project schedule.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the schedule management plan and scope baseline.
- **Project Documents** – Includes activity list, attributes, resource requirements, resource calendars, and lessons learned.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Historical duration data, productivity metrics, and organizational standards.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Estimating templates, previous project data, and expert resources.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to estimate based on experience with similar activities.
- **Analogous Estimating** – Uses historical data from similar projects to estimate duration.
- **Parametric Estimating** – Uses statistical relationships between variables (e.g., quantity and duration).
- **Three-Point Estimating** – Uses optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates to account for uncertainty.
- **Bottom-Up Estimating** – Aggregates estimates of lower-level components.
- **Data Analysis** – Includes reserve analysis to accommodate schedule risk.
- **Decision Making** – May involve team-based estimation or consensus techniques.
- **Meetings** – Collaboration sessions to validate and finalize duration estimates.

---

## Outputs

- **Duration Estimates** – Quantified timeframes (e.g., days, weeks) for each activity, often with a range or confidence level.
- **Basis of Estimates** – Documentation explaining the assumptions, data sources, and methods used.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to activity attributes and assumption log based on the estimation process.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Planning Process Group**, Estimate Activity Durations ensures time is realistically allocated before sequencing and scheduling.
- In **Project Schedule Management**, it supports the creation of accurate and defensible timelines.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Supports Accurate Scheduling** – Helps develop a realistic and achievable project timeline.
- **Accounts for Uncertainty** – Encourages the use of multipoint estimates to reflect variability and risk.
- **Improves Resource Planning** – Informs when and how long resources will be needed.
- **Builds Confidence** – Stakeholders trust schedules that are based on sound estimation methods.
