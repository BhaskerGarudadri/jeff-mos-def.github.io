## Process: Define Activities

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Schedule Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Define Activities** process involves **identifying and documenting the specific actions** required to produce the project deliverables. These activities are derived from the work packages defined in the WBS and form the foundation for estimating, scheduling, and monitoring project progress.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the schedule management plan and scope baseline (WBS, WBS dictionary).
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Standards, tools, and organizational culture that influence activity definition.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Activity lists, templates, and historical information from similar projects.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to break down work packages into activities based on knowledge and experience.
- **Decomposition** – The primary technique for breaking work packages into distinct, manageable tasks.
- **Rolling Wave Planning** – Progressive elaboration of work that will be done in the near term with more detail than future tasks.
- **Meetings** – Involving team members and stakeholders to confirm activity lists and ensure completeness.

---

## Outputs

- **Activity List** – A comprehensive list of all schedule activities required for the project.
- **Activity Attributes** – Details about each activity, such as ID, description, predecessors, successors, leads/lags, constraints, and responsible resources.
- **Milestone List** – Identifies significant points or events within the schedule, such as approvals or deliverable completions.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- Within the **Planning Process Group**, Define Activities provides the **granular detail needed** to support estimation and sequencing.
- In **Project Schedule Management**, it transforms scope elements (work packages) into actionable tasks.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Enables Accurate Scheduling** – Breaks down work into trackable units that can be sequenced and estimated.
- **Supports Progress Tracking** – Activities serve as the basis for monitoring execution and reporting status.
- **Improves Resource Planning** – Clarifies what needs to be done so resources can be properly allocated.
- **Prevents Overlooked Work** – Ensures that all required actions are identified and documented.
