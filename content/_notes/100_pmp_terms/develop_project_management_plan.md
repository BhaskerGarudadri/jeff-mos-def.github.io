## Process: Develop Project Management Plan

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Integration Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Develop Project Management Plan** process involves **defining, preparing, and coordinating all subsidiary plans** into a single, cohesive document that serves as the **blueprint for how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed**. It integrates inputs from all knowledge areas and sets the framework for decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Charter** – Authorizes the project and provides high-level information and objectives.
- **Outputs from Other Planning Processes** – Includes subsidiary plans from all knowledge areas (scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communication, risk, procurement, stakeholder).
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Organizational culture, infrastructure, project management systems, etc.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Policies, procedures, templates, and historical information that support planning.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Input from individuals with specialized knowledge or past experience in similar projects.
- **Data Gathering** – Includes brainstorming, checklists, and focus groups to identify planning components.
- **Interpersonal and Team Skills** – Conflict management, facilitation, and negotiation for aligning stakeholders.
- **Meetings** – Coordination sessions with stakeholders and team members to develop and align on the plan.

---

## Outputs

- **Project Management Plan** – A comprehensive document composed of:
  - **Subsidiary Plans** (e.g., Scope Management Plan, Schedule Management Plan, Cost Management Plan, etc.)
  - **Baselines**:
    - Scope Baseline
    - Schedule Baseline
    - Cost Baseline
  - **Other Elements**:
    - Change management plan  
    - Configuration management plan  
    - Performance measurement baseline  
    - Project life cycle description  
    - Development approach  
    - Management reviews

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Planning Process Group**, this process is foundational—setting the strategic and tactical roadmap for the entire project.
- Within **Project Integration Management**, it consolidates all planning efforts into a single, unified document that guides project execution and control.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Unifies Planning** – Integrates all components of project planning for clarity and consistency.
- **Guides Execution** – Serves as the reference point for managing project performance.
- **Supports Control** – Provides baselines and control mechanisms for scope, time, and cost.
- **Enables Governance** – Establishes standards for monitoring, reporting, and decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.
