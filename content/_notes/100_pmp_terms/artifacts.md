**Artifacts** are documents and other items produced during a portfolio, program, or project to facilitate management, decision-making, and communication. They provide essential information to project teams, stakeholders, and management.

## Key Aspects of Artifacts
- **Support Project Execution** – Used to track progress, manage risks, and guide decision-making.
- **Can Be Formal or Informal** – Ranges from structured documents to informal reports or working materials.
- **Used Across All Project Phases** – Created and updated throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Help Maintain Transparency** – Provide visibility into project health and performance.

## Types of Artifacts
Artifacts vary based on the methodology used, such as traditional project management (waterfall) or Agile frameworks.

### **Project Management Artifacts**
- **Project Charter** – Defines project objectives, scope, and key stakeholders.
- **Project Management Plan** – Outlines how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled.
- **Risk Register** – Documents identified risks and mitigation strategies.
- **Issue Log** – Tracks problems and resolutions during the project.

### **Agile Artifacts**
- **Product Backlog** – A prioritized list of features or requirements.
- **Sprint Backlog** – Work planned for a single Agile sprint.
- **Burndown Chart** – A visual representation of remaining work versus time.
- **Definition of Done (DoD)** – Criteria that determine when a deliverable is complete.

### **Technical & Deliverable Artifacts**
- **Requirements Documentation** – Captures business and functional needs.
- **Design Specifications** – Provides blueprints for development or construction.
- **Test Plans & Reports** – Defines testing criteria and records test outcomes.
- **User Manuals & Training Materials** – Supports end-user adoption and usage.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A development team maintains an evolving backlog of user stories, sprint reports, and testing results as artifacts throughout the project.

### **Construction Project**
Blueprints, material procurement plans, and progress reports serve as critical artifacts to ensure alignment with architectural and safety standards.

### **Strategic Portfolio Management**
A portfolio manager relies on investment analysis documents and status dashboards to track the performance of multiple projects.

## Why Artifacts Matter
- **Enable Effective Communication** – Ensure stakeholders have access to critical project information.
- **Support Decision-Making** – Provide a historical record of project progress and issues.
- **Improve Accountability** – Help track responsibilities and commitments across teams.
