**Estimate to Complete (ETC)** is the **expected cost required to finish all remaining project work**. It helps project managers determine how much more funding will be needed to complete the project based on current progress and cost performance.

## **Key Aspects of Estimate to Complete**
- **Forecasts Remaining Costs** – Provides insight into future financial needs.
- **Used for Budget Adjustments** – Helps refine cost projections throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Part of Earned Value Management (EVM)** – Works alongside EAC, EV, and AC for performance tracking.
- **Adapts to Performance Trends** – Adjusted based on cost efficiency and project progress.

## **ETC Calculation Methods**
| **Formula** | **When to Use** | **Calculation** |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **ETC = EAC - AC** | If past cost trends continue. | **EAC = \$500,000**, **AC = \$200,000** → **ETC = \$300,000** |
| **ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI** | If cost performance affects remaining work. | **BAC = \$1M**, **EV = \$400K**, **CPI = 0.8** → **ETC = \$750,000** |
| **ETC = New Estimate** | If past variances are no longer relevant. | Manually adjusted based on new cost assumptions. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A **mobile app project** was initially budgeted at **\$800,000** (**BAC**) but has spent **\$400,000** (**AC**) so far.  
The team estimates **ETC = EAC - AC = 750,000 - 400,000 = \$350,000**, meaning **\$350,000 more is needed**.

### **Construction Project**
A **high-rise building project** originally budgeted at **\$5 million** has **completed 60% of planned work** but **is over budget due to material price increases**.  
The **ETC is revised based on adjusted cost projections** to account for higher expenses.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A **digital marketing campaign** with an original **budget of \$200,000** has spent **\$120,000**, but some **advertising costs have increased**.  
The **team recalculates ETC** to determine the remaining budget required to complete the campaign.

## **Why Estimate to Complete Matters**
- **Ensures Accurate Cost Forecasting** – Helps teams plan for remaining expenditures.
- **Identifies Potential Budget Overruns** – Flags financial risks early.
- **Aids in Decision-Making** – Supports project adjustments based on performance.
- **Enhances Financial Transparency** – Keeps stakeholders informed about cost expectations.
