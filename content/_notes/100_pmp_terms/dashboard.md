A **Dashboard** is a **set of charts, graphs, and visual indicators** that display **progress or performance against key project measures**. Dashboards provide **real-time insights** to stakeholders, helping them track project health and make data-driven decisions.

## **Key Aspects of a Dashboard**

- **Provides Real-Time Data** – Ensures teams have up-to-date information.
- **Enhances Stakeholder Communication** – Offers a clear, digestible view of project health.
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Helps identify trends, bottlenecks, and areas needing attention.

## **Common Dashboard Components**

| **Project Progress Chart** | Tracks completion percentage and milestones. |
| **Budget vs. Actual Costs** | Compares planned vs. spent budget. |
| **Task Status Indicators** | Shows tasks as "To Do," "In Progress," or "Completed." |
| **Risk Register Summary** | Highlights active risks and mitigation actions. |
