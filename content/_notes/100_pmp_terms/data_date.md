A **Data Date (DD)** is a **specific point in time** when the **status of the project is recorded**. It serves as a **cutoff date** for updating progress, measuring performance, and generating reports.

## **Key Aspects of a Data Date**
- **Marks the Last Update Point** – Defines the most recent status of the project.
- **Used in Performance Tracking** – Helps analyze schedule, cost, and progress trends.
- **Enables Accurate Forecasting** – Provides a baseline for future projections.
- **Supports Earned Value Management (EVM)** – Used in variance calculations.

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A Scrum team updates their **Data Date at the end of each sprint**, reflecting completed user stories and pending work.

### **Construction Project**
A project manager records **Data Dates weekly** to track **budget spending and construction progress**.

### **Financial Reporting**
A **corporate project dashboard** updates **Data Dates at the end of each fiscal quarter**, aligning with stakeholder reporting cycles.

## **Why Data Dates Matter**
- **Ensures Accurate Reporting** – Standardizes status updates.
- **Improves Project Forecasting** – Helps predict delays or budget variances.
- **Enhances Decision-Making** – Provides real-time insights for stakeholders.
- **Supports Earned Value & Performance Metrics** – Used in project health assessments.
