A **Method** is a defined **means for achieving a specific outcome, output, result, or project deliverable**. It provides a structured approach or procedure that guides how work is performed to meet project objectives. Methods can be formal or informal, standardized or tailored, and may vary based on the project's complexity, industry, and organizational preferences.

### **Role of Methods in Project Management**
- **Enable Consistency** – Ensure repeatable, predictable outcomes across similar types of work.
- **Guide Execution** – Translate strategic goals into actionable steps and procedures.
- **Support Quality and Efficiency** – Help reduce variability and enhance process performance.
- **Allow for Tailoring** – Can be adapted to fit the unique needs of the project or organization.

### **Examples of Methods**
- **Agile Practices** – Iterative development, user stories, daily standups.
- **Waterfall Model** – Sequential phases: requirements → design → build → test → deploy.
- **Risk Assessment Methodologies** – Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis.
- **Estimation Techniques** – Analogous, bottom-up, or parametric estimating.

## Why Methods Matter

- **Promote Standardization** – Helps teams align to organizational practices and governance models.
- **Increase Predictability** – Reduces uncertainty in how work will be performed.
- **Improve Communication** – Establishes a common language and approach among stakeholders.
