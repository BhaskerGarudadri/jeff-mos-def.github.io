A **blocker** is an obstacle that prevents a team from making progress toward its objectives. Blockers disrupt workflow, delay tasks, and require resolution to maintain project momentum. In Agile methodologies, blockers are identified during daily stand-ups or sprint reviews to ensure quick resolution.

## Key Aspects of a Blocker
- **Stops Work Progress** – Prevents a task or project from moving forward.
- **Requires Immediate Attention** – Must be addressed to avoid delays.
- **Can Be Internal or External** – May stem from team limitations, dependencies, or outside factors.
- **Impacts Delivery Timelines** – Can extend project schedules if not resolved quickly.

## Common Types of Blockers
- **Resource Constraints** – Lack of tools, personnel, or funding.
- **Technical Issues** – System failures, software bugs, or integration problems.
- **Dependency Delays** – Waiting on external approvals, third-party vendors, or missing inputs.
- **Organizational Barriers** – Slow decision-making, unclear priorities, or misalignment between teams.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
- A development team is unable to proceed because the database server is down.

### **Construction Project**
- A site crew is blocked due to delayed material deliveries.

### **Marketing Campaign**
- A campaign launch is on hold because legal approval is pending.

## Why Blockers Matter
- **Prevent Productivity Loss** – Ensures teams stay efficient and on track.
- **Minimize Project Delays** – Early identification reduces schedule risks.
- **Improve Risk Mitigation** – Helps project managers proactively address challenges.
- **Enhance Communication** – Encourages transparency about issues impacting work.
