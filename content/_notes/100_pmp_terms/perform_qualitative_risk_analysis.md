## Process: Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Risk Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis** process involves **prioritizing identified risks** for further analysis or action based on their **probability of occurrence, impact on project objectives, urgency, and other factors**. It is a fast, cost-effective method for narrowing focus to the most significant threats and opportunities.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the risk management plan and risk categories.
- **Project Documents** – Includes the risk register, stakeholder register, assumptions log, and lessons learned register.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Industry benchmarks, organizational risk tolerance, and expert availability.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Risk probability-impact matrices, scoring models, and historical data.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Drawn from those with knowledge of the project's context, environment, or industry.
- **Data Gathering** – Interviews, workshops, and questionnaires used to assess probability and impact.
- **Data Analysis**  
  - *Risk probability and impact assessment*  
  - *Probability and impact matrix*  
  - *Assessment of other risk parameters* such as urgency, manageability, proximity, and detectability  

- **Interpersonal and Team Skills** – Facilitation, conflict resolution, and group decision-making techniques.
- **Risk Categorization** – Grouping risks by sources (e.g., technical, external, organizational) or project area.
- **Data Representation**  
  - Hierarchical charts  
  - Risk matrix visualizations  

---

## Outputs

- **Updated Risk Register** – Now includes:
  - Assessed probability and impact levels  
  - Priority rankings  
  - Qualitative descriptions of risk response urgency  
  - Categorization tags  

- **Updated Risk Report** – Enhanced with prioritized risk profiles and potential strategic implications.
- **Project Document Updates** – Refinement of assumptions, stakeholder expectations, and issue logs based on risk analysis results.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- In the **Planning Process Group**, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis **quickly filters risks** to determine where attention and resources should be focused.
- As part of **Project Risk Management**, it provides **subjective but structured insight into the threat landscape**.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Optimizes Resource Allocation** – Helps prioritize which risks deserve detailed attention.
- **Enables Faster Response** – Surfaces high-priority risks earlier in the planning cycle.
- **Supports Decision Making** – Provides visibility into which risks could derail or enhance project objectives.
- **Builds Risk Awareness** – Promotes discussion and team understanding of potential project vulnerabilities.
