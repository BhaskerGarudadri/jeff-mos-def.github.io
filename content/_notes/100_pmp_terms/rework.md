**Rework** is action taken to bring a defective or nonconforming component into compliance with requirements or specifications.

It involves correcting errors, deficiencies, or deviations to ensure that outputs meet defined quality standards and project requirements.

## Key Characteristics

- **Corrective in Nature** – Addresses issues after defects are identified  
- **Specification-Driven** – Aligns deliverables with documented standards  
- **Impacts Cost and Schedule** – May increase resource use and delay progress  
- **Triggers Quality Controls** – Often follows inspection or verification activities  

## Example Scenarios

- Rewriting code modules that failed system integration testing  
- Rebuilding a structural component that did not meet engineering tolerances  
- Revising documentation to correct omissions or inaccuracies  

## Role in Quality and Control Processes

- **Ensures Compliance** – Aligns outputs with technical and contractual obligations  
- **Supports Continuous Improvement** – Provides feedback for process refinement  
- **Reduces Risk of Defects** – Prevents escalation of unresolved quality issues  
- **Feeds into Change Management** – May result in formal change requests or plan updates
