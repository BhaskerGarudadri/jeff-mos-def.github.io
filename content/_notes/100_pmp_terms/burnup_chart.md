A **Burnup Chart** is a graphical representation of the **work completed toward a milestone** over time. It is commonly used in Agile and Scrum methodologies to track progress, ensuring teams stay aligned with project goals.

## Key Aspects of a Burnup Chart
- **Tracks Work Completion** – Shows how much work has been finished over time.
- **Helps Identify Trends** – Reveals whether the team is on pace to meet the milestone.
- **Includes Scope Changes** – Unlike burndown charts, burnup charts can reflect changes in total work.
- **Used in Agile & Scrum** – Helps teams visualize project progress at a glance.

## Components of a Burnup Chart
- **X-Axis (Time)** – Represents days, sprints, or iterations.
- **Y-Axis (Work Completed)** – Measures completed story points, tasks, or effort.
- **Work Completed Line** – Shows the actual progress toward the goal.
- **Total Work Line** – Displays the total scope, which can change over time.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A Scrum team working in a **two-week sprint** uses a Burnup Chart to visualize completed user stories, ensuring they reach the sprint goal.

### **Construction Project**
A construction team tracks completed phases of a building project to compare against the planned schedule.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A marketing team uses a Burnup Chart to monitor completed campaign assets (videos, social media posts, blogs) against the total planned deliverables.

## Why Burnup Charts Matter
- **Improves Visibility** – Clearly shows how much work has been completed.
- **Accounts for Scope Changes** – Unlike burndown charts, burnup charts adjust for added work.
- **Enhances Predictability** – Helps teams assess if they will meet their milestone on time.
- **Supports Agile Decision-Making** – Enables teams to adjust based on real progress data.
