A **Constraint** is a **limiting factor** that affects the execution of a **portfolio, program, project, or process**. Constraints impose **restrictions or boundaries** that must be managed to ensure successful project delivery.

## Key Aspects of Constraints
- **Limit Project Flexibility** – Restrict scope, schedule, cost, or resources.
- **Must Be Considered in Planning** – Directly influence decision-making and risk management.
- **Can Be Internal or External** – May come from organizational policies, regulatory requirements, or market conditions.
- **Affect Project Trade-Offs** – Require balancing among competing priorities.

## Common Types of Constraints
1. **Scope Constraint** – Limits on what the project must deliver.  
   *Example: A software release must include specific core features.*
2. **Time Constraint** – Deadlines that dictate project schedule.  
   *Example: A product launch must occur before a key industry event.*
3. **Cost Constraint** – Budget limitations impacting project execution.  
   *Example: A construction project cannot exceed $5 million in total expenses.*
4. **Resource Constraint** – Restrictions on personnel, equipment, or materials.  
   *Example: Only two developers are available to work on a new feature.*
5. **Quality Constraint** – Requirements that define the minimum acceptable standard.  
   *Example: A medical device must pass strict regulatory testing before approval.*
6. **Regulatory Constraint** – Compliance with legal or industry standards.  
   *Example: A financial institution must adhere to new data privacy laws.*

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A **startup must launch its mobile app within six months** due to investor commitments (time constraint).

### **Construction Project**
A **building project cannot exceed $20 million**, requiring cost-cutting measures (cost constraint).

### **Healthcare Implementation**
A **new patient records system must comply with HIPAA regulations**, affecting design choices (regulatory constraint).

## Why Constraints Matter
- **Define Project Boundaries** – Ensure realistic planning and execution.
- **Impact Risk Management** – Help identify potential issues before they become major problems.
- **Guide Decision-Making** – Force teams to prioritize effectively.
- **Improve Stakeholder Alignment** – Ensure expectations are managed from the outset.
