The **Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)** is the **integrated scope, schedule, and cost baselines** that serve as the foundation for **measuring, managing, and controlling project execution**. It provides a reference point against which actual performance is compared to assess progress and identify variances.

The PMB is a key component of **earned value management (EVM)** and supports accurate forecasting and decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Characteristics

- **Integrated View** – Combines scope, time, and cost into a single measurable baseline  
- **Reference Point** – Used for variance analysis during execution  
- **Authoritatively Approved** – Established and maintained under formal change control  
- **Supports EVM** – Enables earned value calculations like CV, SV, CPI, SPI

## Example Scenarios

- The PMB shows a planned cost of $500K by month 6, but actuals show $600K, indicating a cost overrun  
- Schedule variance is identified by comparing planned vs. actual task completion dates  
- A scope change request triggers an update to the PMB through formal approval

## Why Performance Measurement Baseline Matters

- **Enables Performance Tracking** – Measures cost and schedule performance objectively  
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Informs corrective actions when deviations occur  
- **Strengthens Governance** – Provides a controlled reference for change management  
- **Drives Forecast Accuracy** – Allows projection of future performance based on current trends
