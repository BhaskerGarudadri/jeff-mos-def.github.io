**Crashing** is a **schedule compression technique** used to **shorten the project schedule duration** for the **least incremental cost** by **adding extra resources** such as personnel, equipment, or budget.

## **Key Aspects of Crashing**
- **Accelerates Project Completion** – Reduces schedule duration by increasing effort.
- **Requires Additional Resources** – Extra labor, equipment, or funding is allocated.
- **Minimizes Cost Impact** – Only cost-effective options are considered.
- **Used When Fast-Tracking Isn't Feasible** – Applied when parallel task execution isn't an option.

## **Crashing vs. Fast-Tracking**
| **Method**      | **Description** | **Trade-Offs** |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Crashing**  | Adds resources to reduce duration. | Increases cost but minimizes risk. |
| **Fast-Tracking** | Overlaps tasks to save time. | Increases risk of rework and errors. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A company **hires additional developers** to speed up coding and testing, reducing the release timeline.

### **Construction Project**
A contractor **adds extra shifts and workers** to finish a building ahead of schedule.

### **Event Planning**
A marketing team **outsources graphic design** to meet a product launch deadline.

## **Why Crashing Matters**
- **Shortens Project Duration** – Helps meet tight deadlines.
- **Provides Cost-Effective Acceleration** – Balances cost with schedule benefits.
- **Reduces Late Delivery Risks** – Ensures contractual or regulatory compliance.
- **Enhances Stakeholder Satisfaction** – Addresses urgent project constraints.
