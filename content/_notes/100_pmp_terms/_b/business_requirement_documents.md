A **Business Requirement Document (BRD)** is a formal document that **lists all the requirements** for a specific project. It serves as a blueprint for stakeholders, ensuring alignment on the project’s scope, objectives, and deliverables.

## Key Aspects of a Business Requirement Document
- **Defines Project Scope** – Outlines what the project will and will not cover.
- **Captures Business Needs** – Translates organizational goals into specific requirements.
- **Provides a Reference for Development** – Guides teams on what must be delivered.
- **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment** – Establishes a shared understanding of project expectations.

## Components of a BRD
- **Project Overview** – Defines the purpose and objectives.
- **Business Requirements** – Lists functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Stakeholder Roles** – Identifies key decision-makers and responsibilities.
- **Scope Definition** – Details project boundaries and constraints.
- **Assumptions & Dependencies** – Identifies factors influencing the project.
- **Acceptance Criteria** – Establishes conditions for project completion.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A BRD for a **new e-commerce platform** includes requirements for user authentication, payment processing, and inventory management.

### **Process Improvement**
A **supply chain optimization project** uses a BRD to document required system enhancements and automation goals.

### **Regulatory Compliance**
A financial institution drafts a BRD outlining requirements to meet **new government reporting standards**.

## Why BRDs Matter
- **Prevent Scope Creep** – Clearly defines requirements to avoid uncontrolled changes.
- **Improve Communication** – Ensures alignment between business and technical teams.
- **Support Quality Assurance** – Establishes measurable acceptance criteria.
- **Facilitate Stakeholder Buy-In** – Provides transparency and agreement on project goals.
