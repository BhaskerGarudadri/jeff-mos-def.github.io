**Budget at Completion (BAC)** is the **total approved budget** for a project, program, or work package, representing the sum of all allocated budgets for the work to be performed. It serves as a key reference in **earned value management (EVM)** to compare against actual expenditures and forecast project performance.

## Key Aspects of Budget at Completion (BAC)
- **Represents Total Budgeted Cost** – The full financial allocation for a project.
- **Basis for Performance Tracking** – Used to measure cost efficiency and overruns.
- **Integral to Earned Value Analysis** – Helps in variance calculations and forecasting.
- **Fixed Unless Approved for Change** – Any modifications must go through formal change control.

## BAC Formula
BAC = Σ (All Approved Budgets for Project Activities)

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
- A project to develop a **new mobile app** has a **BAC of $500,000**. This is the total approved budget for development, testing, and deployment.

### **Construction Project**
- A company constructs a **commercial office building** with a **BAC of $10M**. This includes labor, materials, equipment, and contingency reserves.

### **Marketing Campaign**
- A product launch campaign has a **BAC of $200K**, covering advertising, content production, and digital promotions.

## BAC in Earned Value Management (EVM)
BAC is used in several EVM calculations:

- **Cost Performance Index (CPI):**  

  $$
  CPI = EV / AC
  $$

- **Estimate at Completion (EAC) (Assuming Current CPI Holds):**  

  $$
  EAC = BAC / CPI
  $$

- **Variance at Completion (VAC):**  
  
  $$
  VAC = BAC - EAC
  $$

## Why BAC Matters
- **Establishes Cost Baseline** – Defines the financial limit for project expenditures.
- **Supports Forecasting & Variance Analysis** – Helps predict final project costs.
- **Improves Cost Control** – Provides a reference for managing actual expenses.
- **Aids in Risk Management** – Identifies potential overruns before they escalate.
