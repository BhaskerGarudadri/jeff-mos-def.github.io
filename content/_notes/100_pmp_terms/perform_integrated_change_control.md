## Process: Perform Integrated Change Control

**Process Group**: Monitoring and Controlling  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Integration Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Perform Integrated Change Control** process ensures that **all change requests are formally evaluated, approved or rejected, and documented** in a controlled and coordinated manner. It maintains the integrity of the project baselines by managing change in a consistent, transparent, and systematic way.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the change management plan, baselines, and configuration management plan.
- **Project Documents** – Includes issue log, lessons learned register, requirements documentation, and risk reports.
- **Work Performance Reports** – Highlight trends or variances that may trigger change.
- **Change Requests** – Proposals to modify scope, schedule, cost, quality, or any other project element.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Governance frameworks, stakeholder risk tolerance, or regulatory standards.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Change control procedures, templates, historical change logs.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Involves sponsors, technical experts, or functional managers to assess change impact.
- **Change Control Tools** – Digital systems used to submit, track, and manage change requests.
- **Data Analysis** –  
  - *Alternatives Analysis*  
  - *Cost-Benefit Analysis*  
- **Decision Making** –  
  - *Voting*  
  - *Autocratic Decision Making*  
  - *Multicriteria Decision Analysis*  
- **Meetings** – Change control board (CCB) reviews to assess and decide on changes.

---

## Outputs

- **Approved Change Requests** – Formal authorization to implement changes.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Adjustments to baselines or subsidiary plans.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to impacted areas such as schedule forecasts, risk register, and cost estimates.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- Within the **Monitoring and Controlling Process Group**, this process safeguards project alignment by **ensuring only approved changes are implemented**.
- As part of **Project Integration Management**, it centralizes change handling across all knowledge areas and prevents uncontrolled scope creep.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Maintains Project Control** – Ensures changes are aligned with strategic goals and project constraints.
- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Adds discipline to how changes are introduced and managed.
- **Supports Traceability** – Tracks who requested a change, what was decided, and why.
- **Promotes Accountability** – Involves the right people in change decisions, increasing stakeholder buy-in.
