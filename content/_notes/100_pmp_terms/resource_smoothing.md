**Resource Smoothing** is a resource optimization technique in which free and total float are used without affecting the critical path.

It adjusts activity scheduling to optimize resource usage within the available schedule flexibility, ensuring that project duration and critical path remain unchanged.

## Key Characteristics

- **Uses Float** – Shifts non-critical tasks within float boundaries  
- **Preserves Critical Path** – Does not delay the overall project schedule  
- **Balances Resource Utilization** – Avoids spikes or idle periods in resource demand  
- **Applies Only When Flexibility Exists** – Cannot resolve overallocations that require timeline extensions  

## Example Scenarios

- Rescheduling non-critical tasks to reduce resource peaks during specific weeks  
- Adjusting task start dates to level team workload without impacting milestones  
- Reallocating effort across available float to avoid overtime costs  

## Role in Scheduling and Execution

- **Improves Resource Efficiency** – Enhances productivity without compromising deadlines  
- **Maintains Schedule Integrity** – Keeps key dates and dependencies intact  
- **Reduces Operational Strain** – Prevents resource burnout through smoother allocation  
- **Supports Planning Precision** – Works in tandem with leveling to optimize delivery
