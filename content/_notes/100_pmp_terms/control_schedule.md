## Process: Control Schedule

**Process Group**: Monitoring and Controlling  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Schedule Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Control Schedule** process involves **monitoring the status of the project schedule**, identifying deviations, and managing changes to the schedule baseline. Its objective is to **ensure the project stays on track** by evaluating performance data, forecasting outcomes, and implementing corrective actions when needed.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Includes the schedule management plan and the schedule baseline.
- **Project Documents** – Activity attributes, schedule data, lessons learned register, and assumption log.
- **Project Schedule** – The detailed plan against which performance is tracked.
- **Work Performance Data** – Real-time updates on task status, completion, and duration.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Schedule control procedures, reporting templates, and historical data.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Data Analysis**  
  - *Earned Value Analysis (EVA)*  
  - *Iteration Burndown Charts* (Agile)  
  - *Performance Reviews*  
  - *Trend Analysis*  
  - *Critical Path Analysis*  
  - *Variance Analysis*

- **Critical Chain Method** – Considers resource availability and buffers to maintain schedule flexibility.
- **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** – Scheduling software used to collect, analyze, and display schedule data.
- **Resource Optimization** – Adjusting schedules to reflect current resource usage and availability.
- **Leads and Lags** – Modifying dependency timing to optimize schedule flow.
- **Schedule Compression** – Techniques like fast tracking and crashing to recover slippage.

---

## Outputs

- **Work Performance Information** – Interpreted results that reflect current schedule performance vs. plan.
- **Schedule Forecasts** – Predictions of future progress and estimated completion dates (e.g., Estimate at Completion).
- **Change Requests** – Raised when deviations require schedule or plan updates.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Adjustments to the schedule baseline or schedule management plan.
- **Project Document Updates** – Revisions to activity attributes, assumptions, risks, and lessons learned.

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- Within the **Monitoring and Controlling Process Group**, Control Schedule ensures project timeframes remain valid and realistic as execution unfolds.
- As part of **Project Schedule Management**, it integrates analysis and adjustment, keeping the schedule responsive and relevant.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Detects Delays Early** – Enables timely response before delays impact delivery.
- **Enables Forecasting** – Provides future-looking insights to support decision-making.
- **Maintains Stakeholder Confidence** – Keeps communication transparent through accurate reporting.
- **Protects the Baseline** – Ensures changes are evaluated and approved before altering the schedule.
