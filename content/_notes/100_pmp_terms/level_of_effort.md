**Level of Effort (LOE)** is an **activity that does not produce a distinct, measurable deliverable but is necessary for project execution and is tracked over time**. It is typically used for **supporting tasks, administrative work, and management activities**.

### **Key Aspects of Level of Effort**
- **Time-Based Measurement** – Work is tracked based on duration rather than specific output.
- **No Tangible Deliverable** – Unlike discrete effort, LOE activities do not produce a final product.
- **Common in Project Management & Oversight** – Often includes tasks such as supervision, reporting, and maintenance.
- **Influences Project Scheduling** – Used to account for ongoing work without a fixed milestone.

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **Software Development**
- **LOE Activity:** Ongoing system monitoring and incident management.
- **Measurement:** Hours logged per sprint or release cycle.

#### **Construction Project**
- **LOE Activity:** Site supervision and safety compliance checks.
- **Measurement:** Daily oversight throughout project duration.

#### **Event Planning**
- **LOE Activity:** Stakeholder coordination and regular status meetings.
- **Measurement:** Weekly meetings and planning sessions leading up to the event.

## **Why Level of Effort Matters**
- **Ensures Proper Resource Allocation** – Helps plan for ongoing activities that support the project.
- **Improves Scheduling Accuracy** – Accounts for necessary but non-discrete work in project timelines.
- **Enhances Cost Tracking** – Provides visibility into ongoing expenditures tied to project support tasks.
- **Supports Project Oversight** – Enables teams to manage administrative and monitoring efforts effectively.
