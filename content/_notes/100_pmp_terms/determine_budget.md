## Process: Determine Budget

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Cost Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Determine Budget** process involves **aggregating estimated costs of individual activities or work packages** to establish an **authorized cost baseline**. This baseline includes all project costs and provides the benchmark for measuring and managing financial performance throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the cost management plan, resource management plan, and scope baseline.
- **Project Documents** – Cost estimates, basis of estimates, project schedule, and risk register.
- **Business Documents** – Includes the business case and benefits management plan.
- **Agreements** – Contracts or procurement commitments that define financial obligations.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Funding availability, exchange rates, and budgeting tools.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Budgeting policies, templates, and historical project data.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Cost Aggregation** – Summing estimates at the work package level to higher components such as control accounts and the overall project.
- **Reserve Analysis** – Incorporating contingency reserves for known risks and management reserves for unforeseen work.
- **Expert Judgment** – Applied to funding requirements, timing, and cash flow considerations.
- **Historical Information Review** – Reference to actual costs from previous similar projects.
- **Funding Limit Reconciliation** – Ensuring planned expenditures align with funding constraints or staged funding releases.
- **Financing** – Addressing external funding or financial arrangements, if applicable.

---

## Outputs

- **Cost Baseline** – The approved version of the budget, including contingency reserves but excluding management reserves.
- **Project Funding Requirements** – Total expected funding, including cash flow projections and timing.
- **Project Document Updates** – Adjustments to cost estimates, risk register, and assumption log.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- In the **Planning Process Group**, Determine Budget consolidates all cost planning into a **single reference point for performance measurement**.
- Within **Project Cost Management**, it establishes the baseline needed to track spending, forecast future costs, and control changes.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Establishes Financial Targets** – Forms the basis for managing and controlling project cost performance.
- **Aligns with Funding** – Ensures that resources are available when needed, according to the planned schedule.
- **Enables Cost Control** – Provides a reference for measuring variances and initiating corrective actions.
- **Supports Stakeholder Transparency** – Clearly communicates how and when funds will be used.
