An **activity list** is a documented tabulation of scheduled activities, providing details about each activity’s description, identifier, and scope of work. It ensures that all project team members understand what work needs to be performed and helps with scheduling, tracking, and execution.

## Key Components of an Activity List
- **Activity Description** – A clear statement of the task to be completed.
- **Activity Identifier** – A unique code or number for tracking purposes.
- **Detailed Scope** – Defines the work required to complete the activity.
- **Dependencies** – Links to predecessor or successor activities when applicable.

## Example of an Activity List Entry

| Activity ID | Activity Description           | Duration | Dependencies | Resources |
|------------|--------------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| A101       | Develop login authentication  | 10 days  | A100 (Database Setup) | Software Developers |
| A102       | Conduct security testing      | 5 days   | A101         | QA Team  |
| A103       | Deploy authentication module  | 2 days   | A102         | DevOps Team |

## Why an Activity List Matters
- **Enhances Clarity** – Provides a structured breakdown of work for the team.
- **Improves Scheduling** – Helps define the project timeline and dependencies.
- **Facilitates Tracking** – Supports progress monitoring and accountability.
- **Aids in Resource Allocation** – Ensures proper distribution of workforce and materials.
