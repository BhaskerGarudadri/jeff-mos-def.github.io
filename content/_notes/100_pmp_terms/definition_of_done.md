The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a **checklist of all the criteria that must be met** for a deliverable to be considered **complete and ready for customer use**. It ensures consistency, quality, and alignment across teams.

## **Key Aspects of the Definition of Done**
- **Establishes Completion Criteria** – Defines when a work item is fully finished.
- **Ensures Quality & Consistency** – Standardizes deliverable acceptance.
- **Prevents Rework** – Minimizes uncertainty about what "done" means.
- **Supports Agile & Incremental Delivery** – Used in Scrum, Kanban, and Lean workflows.

## **Example Definition of Done Criteria**
| **Category**       | **Criteria** |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Development**   | Code is written, peer-reviewed, and merged into the main branch. |
| **Testing**       | Unit tests pass, integration tests executed, and no critical defects remain. |
| **Documentation** | API documentation updated, user guides written. |
| **Deployment**    | Feature deployed to staging or production environment. |
| **Stakeholder Approval** | Product owner has reviewed and accepted the work. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A Scrum team follows a DoD that includes **passing automated tests, code review completion, and documentation updates** before a feature is marked as done.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A DoD ensures that before a campaign launches, all **social media assets, email templates, and landing pages** meet predefined quality standards.

### **Product Manufacturing**
A manufacturing team uses a DoD to verify that **all product components meet safety regulations and quality checks** before shipping.

## **Why the Definition of Done Matters**
- **Reduces Ambiguity** – Ensures all team members agree on completion standards.
- **Improves Quality Assurance** – Establishes consistent quality measures.
- **Enhances Predictability** – Prevents work from being marked complete prematurely.
- **Supports Continuous Improvement** – Can be refined based on team feedback.
