## Process: Plan Risk Responses

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Risk Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Plan Risk Responses** process involves **developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to address overall project risk and individual risks**. It enables proactive management of both threats and opportunities, improving the project’s chances of success.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the risk management, cost, schedule, and resource plans.
- **Project Documents** – Risk register, risk report, lessons learned register, stakeholder register, and project team assignments.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Risk tolerance, organizational structure, and market conditions.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Risk response strategies, templates, and historical records.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to evaluate response strategies, feasibility, and resource needs.
- **Data Gathering** – Interviews or workshops to refine strategies and identify potential secondary risks.
- **Interpersonal and Team Skills** – Facilitation and negotiation to agree on responses.
- **Strategies for Threats**:  
  - *Avoid*  
  - *Mitigate*  
  - *Transfer*  
  - *Escalate*  
  - *Accept*

- **Strategies for Opportunities**:  
  - *Exploit*  
  - *Enhance*  
  - *Share*  
  - *Escalate*  
  - *Accept*

- **Contingent Response Strategies** – Predefined plans triggered by specific conditions.
- **Decision Making** – Multicriteria decision analysis to evaluate and select best-fit responses.

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- In the **Planning Process Group**, Plan Risk Responses bridges risk analysis with execution by **turning insights into action plans**.
- As part of **Project Risk Management**, it ensures that **identified risks are not just acknowledged—but actively addressed**.

## Why It Matters

- **Reduces Threats and Enhances Opportunities** – Applies proactive strategies to influence outcomes in the project’s favor.
- **Clarifies Accountability** – Assigns ownership of each response to specific individuals or groups.
- **Aligns with Constraints** – Ensures responses are feasible within scope, time, cost, and resource boundaries.
- **Improves Resilience** – Increases project adaptability by planning for uncertainty in advance.
