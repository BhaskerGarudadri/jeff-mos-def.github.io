**Program Charter** is a **document issued by a sponsor** that formally **authorizes the program management team** to use organizational resources to **execute the program**. It establishes the authority, scope, and strategic context of the program, and directly **links the program to the organization’s strategic objectives**.

This document serves as the foundational governance artifact for program initiation and oversight.

- **Strategic Connection** – Aligns the program with enterprise goals and outcomes  
- **Defines Scope and Boundaries** – Sets the framework for program planning and control  
- **Enables Governance** – Supports oversight, escalation, and performance management

## Example Scenarios
