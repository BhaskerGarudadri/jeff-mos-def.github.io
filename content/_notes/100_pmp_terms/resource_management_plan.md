A **Resource Management Plan** is a component of the project management plan that describes how project resources are acquired, allocated, monitored, and controlled.

It provides a structured approach to managing all types of resources—human, material, equipment, and facilities—throughout the project lifecycle to ensure availability and efficiency.
