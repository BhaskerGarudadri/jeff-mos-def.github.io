A **Quality Management Plan** is a **component of the program or project management plan** that describes **how an organization’s policies, procedures, and guidelines will be implemented to achieve the quality objectives**. It defines the approach, standards, roles, and tools used to ensure the project meets the required level of quality for both processes and deliverables.

This plan supports consistent execution, customer satisfaction, and continual improvement throughout the project life cycle.

## Key Characteristics

- **Policy Implementation Blueprint** – Converts organizational quality standards into project-specific procedures  
- **Covers Both Product and Process Quality** – Focuses on outcomes and the methods used to achieve them  
- **Defines Quality Roles and Responsibilities** – Establishes ownership and accountability  
- **Includes Assurance and Control Activities** – Specifies what, how, and when quality will be measured

## Example Scenarios

- A software development project outlines code review, testing protocols, and defect thresholds in its quality plan  
- A construction project defines inspection points, material standards, and supplier certifications  
- The plan identifies metrics such as defect rates, rework levels, and customer satisfaction scores

## Role in Quality Assurance

- **Ensures Consistent Standards** – Aligns execution with organizational expectations  
- **Improves Deliverable Reliability** – Supports validation before final acceptance  
- **Reduces Rework and Cost Overruns** – Catches issues early through process control  
- **Supports Compliance** – Documents the quality framework for audits and stakeholder review
