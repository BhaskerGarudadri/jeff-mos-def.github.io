## Process: Estimate Costs

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Cost Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Estimate Costs** process involves **developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed** to complete project activities. It supports budgeting and financial planning by determining how much each project component will cost based on scope, schedule, and resource requirements.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the cost management plan, scope baseline, and schedule baseline.
- **Project Documents** – Activity list, resource requirements, risk register, lessons learned register, and assumptions log.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Market conditions, exchange rates, labor rates, and cost estimation databases.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Historical cost data, estimation tools, and organizational cost policies.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Provided by subject matter experts or those with past cost estimating experience.
- **Analogous Estimating** – Uses historical data from similar projects to estimate costs.
- **Parametric Estimating** – Applies statistical models or unit cost data to estimate activity costs (e.g., cost per square foot).
- **Bottom-Up Estimating** – Aggregates detailed estimates from the work package level.
- **Three-Point Estimating** – Accounts for uncertainty using optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic cost values.
- **Data Analysis** – Includes reserve analysis to account for contingency and potential cost risk.
- **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** – Used for cost modeling and data integration.
- **Decision Making** – Involves team input to refine estimates and validate assumptions.

---

## Outputs

- **Cost Estimates** – Estimated cost for each activity or work package, including direct and indirect costs.
- **Basis of Estimates** – Documentation explaining how estimates were developed, including assumptions, ranges, and confidence levels.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to assumptions, lessons learned, and risk data based on cost insights.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Planning Process Group**, Estimate Costs transforms resource and schedule data into financial projections.
- Within **Project Cost Management**, it provides the data necessary to build the overall project budget and monitor cost performance.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Enables Budgeting** – Supports the development of an accurate and realistic cost baseline.
- **Informs Decision Making** – Helps stakeholders evaluate trade-offs and funding options.
- **Improves Forecasting** – Lays the groundwork for cost control and variance analysis.
- **Reduces Risk** – Increases cost predictability by incorporating uncertainty and historical data.
