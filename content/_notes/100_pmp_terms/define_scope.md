## Process: Define Scope

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Scope Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Define Scope** process involves **developing a detailed description of the project and product**. It transforms high-level requirements and objectives into a clear and actionable **project scope statement** that guides project execution and decision-making throughout the lifecycle.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Charter** – Contains high-level project information and boundaries.
- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the scope management plan and requirements management plan.
- **Project Documents** – Includes assumption log, requirements documentation, and risk register.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Organizational culture, standards, and tools.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Templates, lessons learned, and past project files.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to assess and refine the scope based on organizational knowledge and experience.
- **Data Analysis** – Includes alternatives analysis to evaluate different implementation options.
- **Decision Making** – Techniques like multicriteria decision analysis to finalize scope elements.
- **Interpersonal and Team Skills** – Facilitation and collaboration to align diverse stakeholders.
- **Product Analysis** – Breaks down the product into components and features to define what must be delivered.

---

## Outputs

- **Project Scope Statement** – A detailed narrative that includes:
  - Product scope description  
  - Deliverables  
  - Acceptance criteria  
  - Project exclusions  

- **Project Document Updates** – Revisions to documents such as:
  - Assumption log  
  - Requirements documentation  
  - Requirements traceability matrix  

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- Within the **Planning Process Group**, Define Scope marks the transition from gathering needs to defining what will and will not be done.
- As part of **Project Scope Management**, it creates the scope baseline foundation and sets boundaries for schedule and cost planning.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Clarifies Deliverables** – Defines what the project will produce and how success will be measured.
- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Establishes explicit inclusions and exclusions.
- **Aligns Stakeholders** – Ensures everyone has a shared understanding of what is being delivered.
- **Enables Baseline Creation** – Feeds directly into WBS development and the scope baseline.
