## Process: Develop Schedule

**Process Group**: Planning  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Schedule Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Develop Schedule** process involves **analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and constraints** to create a **detailed project schedule**. It results in a time-based plan used to guide execution and monitor progress, and it forms part of the project’s schedule baseline.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Includes the schedule management plan, scope baseline, and other supporting plans (e.g., cost, resource).
- **Project Documents** – Activity list, attributes, duration estimates, resource calendars, risk register, and assumptions log.
- **Agreements** – Contractual delivery dates or milestones.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Organizational scheduling systems, calendars, and labor rules.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Templates, scheduling tools, and historical project data.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Schedule Network Analysis** – Evaluation of the logical relationships and flow of activities.
- **Critical Path Method (CPM)** – Identifies the longest sequence of activities that determines the project duration.
- **Resource Optimization** – Includes resource leveling and resource smoothing to resolve conflicts or maximize efficiency.
- **What-If Scenario Analysis** – Explores the impact of different assumptions or constraints.
- **Leads and Lags** – Adjustments applied to dependencies to optimize flow.
- **Schedule Compression** – Techniques like crashing and fast tracking to shorten the schedule.
- **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** – Software used to build, track, and update the schedule.
- **Agile Release Planning** – For adaptive projects, aligns incremental deliverables to a high-level timeline.

---

## Outputs

- **Schedule Baseline** – The approved version of the schedule used to measure performance.
- **Project Schedule** – A detailed timeline (bar charts, milestone charts, network diagrams) showing when project activities will occur.
- **Schedule Data** – Includes activity start/finish dates, float, resource needs, and assumptions.
- **Project Calendars** – Specifies working days and hours for scheduling.
- **Change Requests** – If planning reveals scope, resource, or timing issues requiring updates.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Especially to the schedule management plan and other affected components.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to activity data, assumptions, and risks.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Planning Process Group**, Develop Schedule consolidates the results of earlier processes (Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Durations) into a usable schedule.
- Within **Project Schedule Management**, it establishes the **baseline and timeline** that guides and controls project execution.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Defines the Timeline** – Sets expectations for when work will be completed.
- **Enables Tracking** – Provides the reference point for measuring schedule performance.
- **Reveals the Critical Path** – Highlights which activities affect the project’s end date.
- **Informs Resource Decisions** – Helps align availability and demand for team members and assets.
