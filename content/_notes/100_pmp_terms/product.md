**Product** is an **artifact that is produced, is quantifiable**, and can be either an **end item in itself** or a **component item**. Products are the tangible or intangible outcomes created through project work and are delivered to satisfy customer, stakeholder, or organizational needs.

A product may be a standalone deliverable or part of a larger system, and it can be physical, digital, or conceptual.

## Key Characteristics

- **Quantifiable Output** – Can be measured, verified, and validated  
- **End Item or Component** – May serve as a finished deliverable or part of something larger  
- **Customer-Focused** – Created to meet requirements and deliver value  
- **Central to Scope** – Directly tied to the project’s defined objectives

## Example Scenarios

- A manufactured engine part delivered as a component of a vehicle  
- A software application released as the final deliverable of a tech project  
- A training curriculum developed for organizational capacity building

## Why Product Matters

- **Defines Delivery Objectives** – Anchors the project around a concrete goal  
- **Enables Value Realization** – Serves as the means for delivering benefits  
- **Supports Scope Definition** – Clarifies what is included and excluded in the project  
- **Drives Acceptance Criteria** – Provides a basis for stakeholder approval
