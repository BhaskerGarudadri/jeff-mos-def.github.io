A **Gantt Chart** is a **bar chart used for project scheduling**, where:
- **Activities are listed on the vertical axis.**
- **Dates are displayed on the horizontal axis.**
- **Activity durations are represented by horizontal bars** according to their start and finish dates.

## **Key Aspects of Gantt Charts**
- **Visualizes Task Scheduling** – Shows when tasks start and end.
- **Helps Track Project Progress** – Allows easy identification of delays or overlaps.
- **Identifies Dependencies** – Shows how tasks are connected.
- **Works Well with Critical Path Analysis** – Helps in project planning and execution.
