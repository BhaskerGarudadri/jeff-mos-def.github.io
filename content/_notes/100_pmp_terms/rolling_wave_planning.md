**Rolling Wave Planning** is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, while the work in the future is planned at a higher level.

This approach allows project teams to refine planning as more information becomes available, enabling flexibility while maintaining strategic direction.

## Key Characteristics

- **Detail Increases Over Time** – Near-term work is fully defined; future work is progressively elaborated  
- **Supports Uncertainty** – Useful when scope or requirements are not fully known at the outset  
- **Iterative and Adaptive** – Planning cycles occur repeatedly as the project progresses  
- **Schedule-Driven** – Aligned with the timing of work execution  

## Example Scenarios

- Planning only the next two sprints in detail while maintaining a high-level backlog  
- Defining requirements for early-phase construction while later phases remain conceptual  
- Developing a software release plan where later features are scoped broadly but not designed  

## Role in Project Scheduling and Scope Definition

- **Improves Planning Accuracy** – Allows just-in-time detailing based on current knowledge  
- **Reduces Rework** – Avoids premature detailing of uncertain future work  
- **Aligns with Agile and Hybrid Methods** – Compatible with incremental delivery models  
- **Supports Progressive Elaboration** – Expands on scope and schedule as clarity improves
