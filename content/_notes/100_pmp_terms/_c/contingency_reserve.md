A **Contingency Reserve** is **time or money allocated in the schedule or cost baseline** to address **known risks** with active response strategies. It is used when an identified risk occurs, ensuring the project remains on track without requiring additional approvals.

## Key Aspects of a Contingency Reserve
- **Accounts for Known Risks** – Allocated based on identified risks in the **Risk Management Plan**.
- **Part of the Cost or Schedule Baseline** – Included in project planning to handle anticipated uncertainties.
- **Requires Active Response Strategies** – Used only if a predefined risk materializes.
- **Distinct from Management Reserve** – Unlike **management reserves**, contingency reserves are planned for specific risks.

## Types of Contingency Reserves
1. **Cost Contingency Reserve** – Extra funds allocated for potential financial overruns.  
   *Example: A project includes a 10% cost buffer to cover unexpected material price increases.*
2. **Schedule Contingency Reserve** – Extra time added to absorb delays.  
   *Example: A construction project adds two weeks to account for potential weather disruptions.*

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A **development project sets aside $50,000** in contingency reserve for **unexpected infrastructure upgrades**.

### **Construction Project**
A **road construction project includes a contingency reserve** of **10 additional workdays** in case of supply chain delays.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A **global product launch allocates 5% of the total budget** for contingency to address **unexpected regulatory compliance costs** in different regions.

## Why Contingency Reserves Matter
- **Minimizes Financial & Schedule Risks** – Provides a safety net without derailing the project.
- **Improves Planning Accuracy** – Ensures that project estimates are realistic.
- **Supports Effective Risk Management** – Aligns with active risk response strategies.
- **Prevents Unnecessary Escalations** – Reduces the need for last-minute budget or timeline approvals.
