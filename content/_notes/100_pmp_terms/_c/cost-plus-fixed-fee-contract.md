A **Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Contract** is a **cost-reimbursable contract** where the **buyer reimburses the seller for allowable costs** as defined by the contract, **plus a fixed fee** that represents the seller’s profit. The **fixed fee remains constant** regardless of the total project cost.

## **Key Aspects of a CPFF Contract**
- **Covers All Allowable Costs** – The seller is reimbursed for all agreed-upon project expenses.
- **Includes a Fixed Profit Fee** – The seller receives a predetermined amount, unaffected by cost variations.
- **Used in Long-Term & High-Risk Projects** – Common in research, defense, and government contracts.
- **Minimizes Seller Risk** – Ensures the contractor earns a profit, even if project costs increase.
