A **Cause** refers to **events or circumstances that currently exist or are certain to exist in the future, which might give rise to risks**. Causes act as **triggers** that lead to potential uncertainties affecting project objectives.

## Key Aspects of a Cause
- **Precedes a Risk Event** – Exists before the risk occurs.
- **Leads to Uncertainty** – Contributes to threats or opportunities.
- **Can Be Internal or External** – May stem from project decisions or external conditions.
- **Requires Risk Assessment** – Helps in identifying and mitigating risks.

## Types of Causes
- **Technical Causes** – System failures, integration challenges, or design flaws.  
  *Example: Inadequate testing leads to software defects.*
- **Operational Causes** – Process inefficiencies or resource limitations.  
  *Example: Insufficient staff causes project delays.*
- **Environmental Causes** – Market shifts, regulatory changes, or external events.  
  *Example: A new data privacy law increases compliance risks.*

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
- **Cause:** A lack of cybersecurity protocols.  
- **Potential Risk:** Increased vulnerability to data breaches.

### **Construction Project**
- **Cause:** Delayed delivery of building materials.  
- **Potential Risk:** Project timeline extensions and cost overruns.

### **Financial Services**
- **Cause:** High inflation rates.  
- **Potential Risk:** Reduced consumer spending and lower revenue projections.

## Why Causes Matter
- **Improve Risk Identification** – Understanding causes helps teams proactively address risks.
