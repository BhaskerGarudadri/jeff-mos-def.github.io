**Cost of Quality (COQ)** refers to **all costs incurred over the life of a product** due to **investment in preventing nonconformance, appraising conformance, and addressing failures**. It helps organizations assess the financial impact of quality-related activities.

## Key Aspects of Cost of Quality
- **Includes Prevention, Appraisal, and Failure Costs** – Covers proactive and reactive quality expenses.
- **Affects Long-Term Profitability** – Poor quality increases overall costs due to rework and defects.
- **Supports Process Improvement** – Helps organizations balance quality investments for optimal efficiency.
- **Used in Quality Management Strategies** – Helps decision-makers allocate resources for cost-effective quality control.

## Categories of Cost of Quality
| **Category**        | **Description** | **Example** |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Prevention Costs** | Expenses to avoid defects before they occur. | Training, process improvements, supplier audits. |
| **Appraisal Costs** | Costs of measuring and monitoring quality. | Inspection, testing, quality audits. |
| **Internal Failure Costs** | Costs due to defects detected before reaching customers. | Rework, scrap, retesting. |
| **External Failure Costs** | Costs due to defects found after reaching customers. | Warranty claims, refunds, legal liability. |

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A company **invests in automated testing** (prevention cost) to reduce post-release defects and **avoid costly bug fixes** (failure cost).

### **Manufacturing**
A factory **conducts routine product inspections** (appraisal cost) to detect **assembly defects before shipment** (reducing external failure costs).

### **Healthcare**
A hospital **trains staff on patient safety protocols** (prevention cost) to **reduce medical errors and liability risks** (external failure cost).

## Why Cost of Quality Matters
- **Reduces Overall Expenses** – Investing in prevention lowers failure-related costs.
- **Improves Customer Satisfaction** – Fewer defects lead to higher product reliability.
- **Enhances Competitive Advantage** – High-quality products strengthen brand reputation.
- **Supports Process Efficiency** – Identifies cost-effective ways to improve quality management.
