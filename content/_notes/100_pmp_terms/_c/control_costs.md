## Process: Control Costs

**Process Group**: Monitoring and Controlling  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Cost Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Control Costs** process involves **monitoring the status of the project to update the budget and manage changes to the cost baseline**. It ensures the project remains within its authorized budget and uses performance data to detect variances and take corrective actions.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the cost management plan, cost baseline, and performance measurement baseline.
- **Project Documents** – Includes lessons learned register, cost estimates, and risk register.
- **Project Funding Requirements** – Defines when and how funds should be available.
- **Work Performance Data** – Real-time data on costs incurred, progress, and resource use.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Policies, procedures, and historical cost data.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Earned Value Analysis (EVA)** – Combines scope, schedule, and cost data to evaluate project performance.
  - Cost Variance (CV)  
  - Schedule Variance (SV)  
  - Cost Performance Index (CPI)  
  - Estimate at Completion (EAC)  

- **Trend Analysis** – Examines historical performance to predict future costs.
- **Variance Analysis** – Compares actual costs against baseline to identify and explain deviations.
- **Reserve Analysis** – Evaluates use of contingency and management reserves.
- **To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)** – Calculates the efficiency required to meet the remaining budget.

---

## Outputs

- **Work Performance Information** – Interpreted results showing how the project is performing financially.
- **Cost Forecasts** – Updated projections for future spending (e.g., Estimate to Complete, Estimate at Completion).
- **Change Requests** – Initiated when performance issues require budget adjustments.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Changes to the cost baseline or performance thresholds.
- **Project Document Updates** – Adjustments to risk register, lessons learned, and cost-related documents.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Monitoring and Controlling Process Group**, Control Costs ensures that financial performance is regularly assessed and adjusted as necessary.
- Within **Project Cost Management**, it keeps spending aligned with approved budgets and supports effective cost governance.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Ensures Financial Health** – Detects cost overruns early to enable timely corrective actions.
- **Supports Decision Making** – Provides actionable insights for adjusting plans and forecasts.
- **Protects the Baseline** – Maintains control over authorized budget changes.
- **Drives Accountability** – Tracks spending performance across teams and components.
