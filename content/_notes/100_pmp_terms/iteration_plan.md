## **Iteration Plan**
An **Iteration Plan** is a **detailed plan for the current iteration**, outlining the **scope, objectives, tasks, and deliverables** for a specific development cycle. It helps teams stay **focused, aligned, and accountable** during short, time-boxed work periods.

### **Key Aspects of an Iteration Plan**
- **Defines Goals for the Iteration** – Establishes what will be delivered.
- **Breaks Down Work into Tasks** – Specifies responsibilities and assignments.
- **Identifies Dependencies & Risks** – Highlights potential blockers.
- **Provides a Timeline for Completion** – Ensures work fits within the iteration window.
