**Lag** is the **amount of time a successor activity is delayed after the completion of its predecessor activity**. It represents a waiting period intentionally added to the schedule to account for necessary delays between tasks.

### **Key Aspects of Lag**
- **Delays Task Start** – Prevents a successor activity from beginning immediately after its predecessor.
- **Common in Construction & Manufacturing** – Used when tasks require curing, drying, or waiting periods.
- **Impacts Project Timeline** – Affects the critical path and scheduling dependencies.
- **Defined in Dependency Relationships** – Often seen in **finish-to-start** and other logical relationships.

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **Construction Project**
- **Use Case:** Concrete pouring requires a **curing period** before further work.
- **Lag Applied:** A **3-day delay** before starting flooring installation.

#### **Software Development**
- **Use Case:** Backend API development must be completed before frontend integration.
- **Lag Applied:** A **1-week buffer** to allow testing before UI work begins.

#### **Event Planning**
- **Use Case:** Promotional materials need time for printing before distribution.
- **Lag Applied:** A **5-day delay** for production before marketing activities begin.

## **Why Lag Matters**
- **Ensures Proper Sequencing** – Allows for natural delays where necessary.
- **Prevents Premature Task Start** – Avoids issues caused by overlapping activities.
- **Affects Project Scheduling** – Helps accurately define time dependencies.
- **Optimizes Resource Allocation** – Prevents idle time by planning necessary delays.
