A **Model** is a **visual representation of information**, either abstract or specific, that follows a set of **guidelines or conventions** to organize and communicate complex ideas efficiently. Models help simplify reality, making it easier to understand systems, relationships, and processes in the context of a project, program, or portfolio.

### **Purpose and Characteristics**
- **Simplifies Complexity** – Abstracts details to highlight key structures or interactions.
- **Follows Structure** – Built using defined rules or standards to ensure consistency and clarity.
- **Supports Communication** – Bridges gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Enhances Analysis** – Aids in identifying patterns, risks, gaps, or dependencies.

### **Examples of Common Models**
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** – Hierarchical model of project scope.
- **Process Flow Diagram** – Visual model of steps in a process.
- **Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)** – Tree-like model of potential risk sources.
- **SWOT Analysis** – Quadrant model for evaluating strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
- **PERT Chart** – Network model used to estimate project duration based on activity dependencies.

### **When to Use Models**
- During early planning to align understanding
- To support presentations or workshops
- While analyzing trade-offs or dependencies
- For status tracking and performance reporting

## Why Models Matter

- **Improve Clarity** – Make abstract or detailed information more digestible.
- **Enable Better Decisions** – Highlight cause-effect relationships or structural constraints.
- **Enhance Collaboration** – Provide a shared frame of reference for diverse stakeholders.
