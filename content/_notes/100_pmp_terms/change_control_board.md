The **Change Control Board (CCB)** is a **formally chartered group** responsible for **reviewing, evaluating, approving, delaying, or rejecting changes** to a project. The CCB ensures that modifications align with project objectives and do not negatively impact scope, schedule, cost, or quality.

## Key Aspects of a Change Control Board (CCB)
- **Evaluates Proposed Changes** – Assesses the feasibility and impact of requested modifications.
- **Maintains Project Stability** – Prevents unnecessary disruptions by enforcing structured review processes.
- **Ensures Governance & Accountability** – Provides a formal approval mechanism for project changes.
- **Communicates Change Decisions** – Records and shares approved or rejected modifications with stakeholders.

## Responsibilities of the CCB
1. **Review Change Requests** – Analyze the impact of modifications.
2. **Approve, Delay, or Reject Changes** – Make decisions based on project objectives.
3. **Ensure Documentation** – Record all decisions and update relevant project documents.
4. **Communicate Outcomes** – Notify stakeholders of approved or denied changes.
5. **Monitor Change Implementation** – Ensure that approved changes are executed properly.

## Example Scenario

### **Software Development**
A project manager submits a request to **add a new reporting feature** to an application. The **CCB reviews** the request, assesses **impact on budget and timeline**, and **approves** it with a **revised schedule**.

### **Construction Project**
A contractor requests a **change in building materials** due to supply chain delays. The CCB **analyzes cost differences** and **approves the change** under specific conditions.

### **Business Operations**
A compliance team requests an update to **financial reporting processes**. The CCB ensures that the change meets **regulatory standards** before approval.

## Why the CCB Matters
- **Prevents Scope Creep** – Ensures changes align with project objectives.
- **Reduces Project Risks** – Evaluates potential risks before approving modifications.
- **Improves Stakeholder Alignment** – Ensures all key parties are involved in decision-making.
- **Enhances Change Control Discipline** – Creates a structured, documented change approval process.
