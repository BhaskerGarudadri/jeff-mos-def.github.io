**Cycle Time** is the **total elapsed time from the start of a particular activity or work item to its completion**. It is a key performance metric used in **Agile, Lean, and process improvement methodologies** to measure **efficiency and workflow optimization**.

## **Key Aspects of Cycle Time**
- **Measures Work Completion Speed** – Tracks how long a task takes from initiation to completion.
- **Helps Identify Bottlenecks** – Longer cycle times may indicate inefficiencies.
- **Differs from Lead Time** – Cycle Time starts when work begins, whereas Lead Time includes waiting periods before work starts.
- **Used in Continuous Improvement** – Helps optimize processes and reduce delays.

## **Cycle Time Formula**
$$
\text{Cycle Time} = \text{Completion Date} - \text{Start Date}
$$
For example, if a task starts on **March 1st** and finishes on **March 5th**, the Cycle Time is **4 days**.

## **Cycle Time vs. Lead Time**
| **Metric**       | **Definition** | **Example** |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Cycle Time**  | Time from when work starts to when it is completed. | A developer begins coding a feature on Monday and finishes by Friday (5 days). |
| **Lead Time**   | Time from when a request is made to when it is completed. | A feature is requested on January 1st, development starts on March 1st, and finishes on March 5th (64 days). |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A **Kanban team** tracks Cycle Time to measure how long a **user story takes from development start to completion**, helping optimize sprint performance.

### **Manufacturing**
A factory **calculates Cycle Time for product assembly**, reducing delays by improving workflow automation.

### **Customer Service**
A company measures the **Cycle Time for resolving support tickets**, ensuring faster response times and customer satisfaction.

## **Why Cycle Time Matters**
- **Improves Workflow Efficiency** – Identifies process slowdowns.
- **Enhances Predictability** – Helps forecast delivery timelines.
- **Supports Process Optimization** – Enables teams to streamline operations.
- **Reduces Waste in Lean & Agile Projects** – Ensures teams focus on high-value tasks.
