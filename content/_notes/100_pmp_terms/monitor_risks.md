## Process: Monitor Risks

**Process Group**: Monitoring and Controlling  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Risk Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Monitor Risks** process involves **tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness** throughout the project. It ensures the risk management plan remains relevant and that responses are implemented and working.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the risk management plan, risk response strategies, and baselines.
- **Project Documents** – Risk register, risk report, issue log, lessons learned register, and assumption log.
- **Work Performance Data** – Information on project execution that could indicate risk triggers or deviations.
- **Work Performance Reports** – Summarized results used to analyze the effectiveness of responses and control decisions.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Data Analysis**  
  - Technical performance analysis  
  - Reserve analysis  
  - Trend analysis  
  - Variance analysis  

- **Audits** – Formal reviews to verify that risk management processes are being followed and are effective.
- **Meetings** – Regular risk review sessions with stakeholders and team members to evaluate status and adapt plans.
- **Risk Reassessment** – Periodic updates to identify new risks and review existing ones.
- **Risk Reviews** – Structured evaluation of risk status and performance across project phases.

---

## Outputs

- **Work Performance Information** – Interpreted insights on how well risks are being managed.
- **Change Requests** – Recommended updates to response plans, baselines, or risk strategies based on monitoring results.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Adjustments to risk, cost, schedule, or communications plans.
- **Project Document Updates** – Ongoing updates to risk register, risk report, assumption log, and lessons learned register.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Monitoring and Controlling Process Group**, Monitor Risks ensures **risk-related information is continuously evaluated**.
- Within **Project Risk Management**, it validates that risk responses are working, that no new threats are ignored, and that plans adapt to changing conditions.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Sustains Proactive Risk Management** – Keeps risk awareness alive and evolving with the project.
- **Improves Strategy Effectiveness** – Evaluates which responses are working and which need adjustment.
- **Ensures Timely Action** – Detects new or escalating risks early so they can be addressed before impact.
- **Drives Continuous Learning** – Captures insights and lessons that improve risk performance in current and future projects.
