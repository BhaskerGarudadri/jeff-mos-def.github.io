A **Change Request** is a **formal proposal** to modify a **document, deliverable, or baseline** in a project. It is submitted for review and approval before any changes are implemented to ensure alignment with project objectives and constraints.

## Key Aspects of a Change Request
- **Requires Formal Documentation** – Must be recorded and submitted through the **Change Control System**.
- **Can Impact Scope, Schedule, Cost, or Quality** – Assessed for feasibility and risks before approval.
- **Reviewed by the Change Control Board (CCB)** – Evaluated by project stakeholders before a decision is made.
- **Prevents Uncontrolled Changes** – Ensures modifications follow a structured process.

## Types of Change Requests
1. **Corrective Action** – Adjustments made to bring project performance back in line with the plan.  
   *Example: Increasing testing efforts to reduce defect rates.*
2. **Preventive Action** – Changes made to avoid potential future issues.  
   *Example: Strengthening security measures to prevent data breaches.*
3. **Defect Repair** – Fixes applied to faulty project deliverables.  
   *Example: Modifying code to resolve a system bug.*
4. **Scope Changes** – Modifications to project requirements or deliverables.  
   *Example: Adding new features to a software release.*

## Example Scenario

### **Software Development**
A development team submits a **Change Request** to **extend the project timeline** after identifying the need for additional security testing.

### **Construction Project**
A contractor files a **Change Request** to **substitute materials** due to supply shortages, requiring approval from the project owner.

### **Business Operations**
A compliance officer submits a **Change Request** to **update financial reporting processes** in response to new regulatory requirements.

## Why Change Requests Matter
- **Ensure Structured Change Management** – Prevents undocumented or unauthorized modifications.
- **Improve Project Adaptability** – Allows for controlled adjustments while maintaining project stability.
- **Enhance Decision-Making** – Provides a formal process for evaluating and approving changes.
- **Reduce Risks & Delays** – Ensures changes are assessed for impact before implementation.
