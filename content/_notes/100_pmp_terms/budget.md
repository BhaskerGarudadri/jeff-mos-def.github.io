A **budget** is the approved estimate for a **portfolio, program, or project**, as well as for any **work breakdown structure (WBS) component or schedule activity**. It represents the allocated financial resources and serves as a baseline for **cost control and performance measurement** throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Aspects of a Budget
- **Defines Financial Limits** – Establishes spending constraints for the project.
- **Includes Cost Components** – Covers labor, materials, equipment, and overhead.
- **Used for Performance Tracking** – Helps monitor actual vs. planned expenditures.
- **Requires Change Control for Adjustments** – Modifications must go through formal approval processes.

## Budget Components
- **Project Cost Baseline** – The approved, time-phased budget for project activities.
- **Contingency Reserves** – Funds set aside for identified risks.
- **Management Reserves** – Extra funds allocated for unforeseen risks.
- **Funding Requirements** – The timing and amount of financial resources needed.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
- A company sets a **budget of $1M** for an ERP system implementation, allocating funds for development, testing, deployment, and training.

### **Construction Project**
- A construction firm approves a **$10M budget** for a new office building, including material costs, labor, and contingency reserves.

### **Marketing Campaign**
- A marketing department sets a **$200K budget** for a product launch, covering advertising, content creation, and influencer partnerships.

## Why a Budget Matters
- **Ensures Financial Discipline** – Prevents overspending and resource misallocation.
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Provides clarity on funding availability.
- **Enhances Stakeholder Confidence** – Demonstrates financial planning and control.
