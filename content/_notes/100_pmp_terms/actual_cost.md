**Actual Cost (AC)** is the total realized cost incurred for work performed on an activity during a specific time period. It reflects the true expenditure of resources, including labor, materials, and overhead, and is a key metric in project cost management.

## Key Aspects of Actual Cost
- **Represents Real Spending** – Tracks what has been spent on a task or project phase.
- **Used in Cost Performance Analysis** – Compared against budgeted costs to assess financial performance.
- **Includes Direct and Indirect Costs** – Accounts for salaries, materials, equipment, and administrative expenses.
- **Time-Bound** – Measured for a specific reporting period or across the entire project lifecycle.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development Project**
- *Planned Cost for Feature Development:* $10,000  
- *Actual Cost Incurred:* $12,500  
- *Analysis:* Over-budget by $2,500, requiring review of scope and resource allocation.

### **Construction Project**
- *Planned Cost for Material Procurement:* $50,000  
- *Actual Cost:* $48,000  
- *Analysis:* Under budget, potentially freeing resources for other project areas.

## Why Actual Cost Matters
- **Supports Cost Control** – Helps project managers track and manage expenses.
- **Improves Budget Forecasting** – Provides insights for future cost estimates.
- **Feeds into Earned Value Analysis** – Used to calculate performance metrics like Cost Performance Index (CPI).
