The **Project Schedule** is an **output of a schedule model** that presents **linked activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources**. It represents the timeline of project execution and serves as a baseline for tracking progress, coordinating work, and managing expectations.

This schedule reflects the logical relationships among activities and supports day-to-day planning and stakeholder communication.

## Key Characteristics

- **Time-Based Representation** – Displays when activities are expected to start and finish  
- **Dependency-Linked Activities** – Reflects sequencing and relationships between tasks  
- **Includes Milestones and Deadlines** – Highlights key events and delivery points  
- **Resource-Aware** – Aligns tasks with assigned team members and availability

## Example Scenarios

- A Gantt chart outlines all phases of a product development project, from design to release  
- The schedule for a facility build lists activities, durations, and resource assignments across six months  
- A team uses the schedule to monitor critical path progress and adjust upcoming work accordingly

## Role in Project Execution

- **Guides Daily Work** – Provides structure for task execution and coordination  
- **Enables Monitoring and Control** – Baseline for comparing planned vs. actual progress  
- **Improves Forecasting** – Identifies potential delays and opportunities for acceleration  
- **Supports Communication** – Keeps stakeholders informed on status and timelines
