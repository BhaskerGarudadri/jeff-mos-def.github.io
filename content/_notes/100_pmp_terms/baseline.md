A **baseline** is the approved version of a work product that serves as a reference point for measuring project performance. Once established, a baseline can only be modified through formal **change control procedures**. It provides a standard for comparing actual project results to the original plan.

## Key Aspects of a Baseline
- **Fixed Reference Point** – Establishes a snapshot of project scope, cost, or schedule at a specific time.
- **Used for Performance Tracking** – Compares planned vs. actual progress to identify deviations.
- **Change-Controlled** – Modifications require formal approval to ensure project integrity.
- **Supports Decision-Making** – Provides stakeholders with clear visibility into project health.

## Types of Baselines
- **Scope Baseline** – Defines the approved project scope, including requirements and deliverables.
- **Schedule Baseline** – The approved project timeline, including start and end dates.
- **Cost Baseline** – The approved project budget, used to monitor expenditures.
- **Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)** – A combination of scope, schedule, and cost baselines used in earned value management (EVM).

## Example Scenarios

### **Construction Project**
- A project manager sets a **schedule baseline** of 12 months for a building project. If actual work extends to 14 months, variance analysis helps determine the cause of the delay.

### **Software Development**
- A **scope baseline** for a mobile app includes specific features such as user authentication and push notifications. If new features are added, formal change control is required.

### **Budget Control**
- A **cost baseline** for a product launch is set at $500,000. If expenses exceed this, project managers analyze cost overruns and adjust spending accordingly.

## Why Baselines Matter
- **Enable Performance Measurement** – Help track deviations from the approved plan.
- **Support Change Control** – Ensure modifications are evaluated before implementation.
- **Improve Forecasting** – Provide historical data to enhance future project planning.
- **Enhance Accountability** – Establish clear expectations for project outcomes.
