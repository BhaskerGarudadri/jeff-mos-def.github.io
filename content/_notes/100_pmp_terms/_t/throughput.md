**Throughput** is the number of items passing through a process.

It measures how many work items—such as tasks, user stories, or deliverables—are completed in a given period of time, providing insight into team productivity, workflow efficiency, and delivery pace.

## Key Characteristics

- **Volume-Based Metric** – Focuses on quantity of output, not effort or duration  
- **Time-Boxed** – Typically measured per sprint, week, or month  
- **Used in Flow-Based Systems** – Core metric in Kanban and other continuous delivery models  
- **Supports Forecasting** – Helps predict future delivery based on historical flow  

## Example Scenarios

- Completing 12 user stories during a two-week sprint  
- Processing 30 help desk tickets in a week  
- Delivering 100 features during a program increment  

## Role in Agile and Lean Delivery

- **Measures Delivery Rate** – Quantifies how much value is delivered over time  
- **Enables Predictability** – Provides a foundation for flow-based planning and forecasting  
- **Highlights Bottlenecks** – Low throughput may indicate process inefficiencies  
- **Supports Continuous Improvement** – Informs adjustments to team workflows and capacity
