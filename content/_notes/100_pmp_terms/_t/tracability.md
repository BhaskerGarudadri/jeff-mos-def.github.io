**Traceability** is the ability to track information across the product life cycle by establishing linkages among objects.

It enables forward and backward visibility between requirements, design, development, testing, and delivery artifacts. Traceability supports validation, change control, and compliance by ensuring that every requirement is accounted for and aligned with deliverables and verification results.

## Key Characteristics

- **Bidirectional** – Supports tracing both forward (from requirements to outcomes) and backward (from outcomes to requirements)  
- **Lifecycle-Spanning** – Applies across planning, execution, and verification phases  
- **Linkage-Based** – Connects related artifacts such as requirements, tests, and components  
- **Supports Compliance and Auditability** – Essential in regulated environments and quality assurance  

## Example Scenarios

- Tracing a business requirement through design, development, and testing to confirm delivery  
- Identifying which test cases validate which functional requirements  
- Using traceability to analyze the impact of a proposed change in scope  

## Role in Project and Quality Management

- **Ensures Completeness** – Confirms that all requirements are implemented and tested  
- **Improves Change Control** – Enables impact assessment when modifications are proposed  
- **Supports Verification and Validation** – Aligns project outcomes with initial objectives  
- **Enhances Transparency** – Provides clear documentation of how work aligns with goals
