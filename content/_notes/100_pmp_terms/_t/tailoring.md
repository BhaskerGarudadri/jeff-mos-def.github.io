**Tailoring** is the deliberate adaptation of approach, governance, and processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and the work at hand.

It involves selecting and adjusting tools, techniques, life cycle models, and management practices to align with organizational needs, project characteristics, stakeholder expectations, and external conditions, ensuring that delivery is efficient and context-appropriate.

## Key Characteristics

- **Intentional and Contextual** – Based on analysis of organizational, project, and stakeholder factors  
- **Scalable and Flexible** – Enables use of frameworks without strict adherence to one-size-fits-all rules  
- **Governance-Aligned** – Adapts compliance, oversight, and approval paths based on environment  
- **Supports Multiple Domains** – Applied across scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, procurement, and more  

## Example Scenarios

- Reducing documentation requirements in an agile-driven project with low regulatory oversight  
- Adding formal stage gates to a high-risk, multi-year capital program  
- Combining predictive and adaptive practices in a hybrid development environment  

## Role in Project and Program Management

- **Improves Relevance and Efficiency** – Ensures that processes add value and support outcomes  
- **Enhances Agility and Responsiveness** – Adapts to change without sacrificing structure  
- **Supports Organizational Standards** – Aligns enterprise governance with delivery flexibility  
- **Drives Informed Decision-Making** – Encourages conscious customization, not ad hoc change
