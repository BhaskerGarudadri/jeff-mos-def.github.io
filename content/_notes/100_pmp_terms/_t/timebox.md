A **Timebox** is a short, fixed period of time in which work is to be completed.

It sets a clear boundary for duration, enforcing focus, commitment, and efficiency. Timeboxing is widely used in Agile frameworks to structure activities such as iterations, ceremonies, and spikes, where scope is adjusted to fit the time—not the other way around.

## Key Characteristics

- **Fixed Duration** – Time is set in advance and not extended  
- **Scope-Flexible** – Work is planned to fit within the boundary, not expanded beyond it  
- **Promotes Discipline** – Encourages timely decision-making and reduces over-analysis  
- **Used Across Agile Events** – Applies to sprints, daily stand-ups, reviews, and more  

## Example Scenarios

- A two-week sprint in Scrum  
- A 15-minute daily stand-up meeting  
- A four-hour timebox for sprint planning or a spike investigation  

## Role in Agile and Time Management

- **Improves Predictability** – Establishes reliable cadences for planning and delivery  
- **Supports Focus** – Reduces distractions and context switching  
- **Enhances Efficiency** – Limits time spent on low-value activities  
- **Enables Empirical Process Control** – Promotes inspect-and-adapt cycles at regular intervals
