A **Test Plan** is a document describing deliverables that will be tested, tests that will be conducted, and the processes that will be used in testing.

It defines the scope, objectives, schedule, responsibilities, environment, and criteria for success and completion of testing efforts, ensuring that verification activities are structured, traceable, and aligned with project requirements.

## Key Characteristics

- **Scope-Defined** – Specifies what will and won’t be tested  
- **Process-Oriented** – Outlines test types, methods, tools, and environments  
- **Includes Entry and Exit Criteria** – Sets conditions for beginning and completing testing  
- **Linked to Deliverables** – Tied directly to system components, features, or milestones  

## Example Scenarios

- Defining a test plan for validating user authentication and access control  
- Outlining regression testing for a software release cycle  
- Preparing a test plan for system integration across hardware platforms  

## Role in Project and Quality Management

- **Ensures Product Validation** – Confirms deliverables meet specified requirements  
- **Supports Quality Assurance** – Standardizes testing practices and acceptance criteria  
- **Improves Risk Mitigation** – Identifies defects early to reduce downstream impact  
- **Feeds Into Project Planning** – Integrated with the project schedule and resource plan
