A **Trigger Condition** is an event or situation that indicates that a risk is about to occur.

It serves as an early warning signal, enabling the project team to act proactively before the risk fully materializes. Identifying trigger conditions allows for timely risk response activation and is a critical part of effective risk monitoring.

## Key Characteristics

- **Predictive in Nature** – Indicates the approach of a potential risk  
- **Actionable** – Tied to predefined risk response plans  
- **Documented in Risk Register** – Linked to specific risks during planning  
- **Monitored Continuously** – Reviewed during project execution for early detection  

## Example Scenarios

- A delay in receiving critical materials triggers the risk of missing a milestone  
- High turnover during a project signals a resourcing risk  
- A negative test result signals the risk of technical failure  

## Role in Risk Monitoring and Control

- **Enables Proactive Action** – Helps initiate responses before full impact  
- **Improves Risk Visibility** – Keeps the team alert to emerging issues  
- **Supports Timely Escalation** – Allows intervention before risk escalation  
- **Strengthens Control Mechanisms** – Integrates into the overall risk management strategy
