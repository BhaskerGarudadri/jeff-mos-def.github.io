**To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)** is a measure of the cost performance that should be achieved with the remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to the remaining budget.

It answers the question: “How efficiently must we perform the remaining work to stay within the budget or target?” A TCPI greater than 1.0 indicates a need to improve cost efficiency; less than 1.0 suggests remaining work can be performed with lower efficiency.

## Key Characteristics

- **Performance Forecast Metric** – Focuses on future cost efficiency  
- **Threshold Indicator** – Compares against current cost performance to assess feasibility  
- **Calculated Using EV, BAC, AC, and EAC** – Based on actual and forecasted financials  
- **Supports Informed Decision-Making** – Identifies urgency of corrective action  

## Formulas

To meet the **Budget at Completion (BAC):**

$$
\text{TCPI}_{\text{BAC}} = \frac{BAC - EV}{BAC - AC}
$$

To meet the **Estimate at Completion (EAC):**

$$
\text{TCPI}_{\text{EAC}} = \frac{BAC - EV}{EAC - AC}
$$

Where:  
- **BAC** = Budget at Completion  
- **EV** = Earned Value  
- **AC** = Actual Cost  
- **EAC** = Estimate at Completion  

## Example Scenarios

- Calculating TCPI when a project is overspending and leadership wants to understand if recovery is possible  
- Comparing current CPI with TCPI to assess the realism of staying on budget  
- Evaluating the level of performance improvement required to meet a revised cost estimate  

## Role in Performance and Forecasting

- **Enables Future Cost Evaluation** – Helps determine if corrective actions are needed  
- **Supports Transparency** – Provides clear numerical targets for financial recovery  
- **Strengthens Control** – Adds depth to cost tracking and reporting activities  
- **Complements CPI and EAC** – Works alongside other EVM metrics for comprehensive insight
