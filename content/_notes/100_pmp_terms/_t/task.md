A **Task** is a specific activity or work that needs to be completed in order to achieve a project goal.

Tasks are the fundamental units of work in a project schedule. They contribute to deliverables and milestones, are typically assigned to individuals or teams, and are defined with clear start and finish parameters to support tracking and control.

## Key Characteristics

- **Action-Oriented** – Represents a discrete piece of work to be performed  
- **Defined Scope and Duration** – Has measurable boundaries and time constraints  
- **Linked to Goals** – Contributes directly to work packages, deliverables, or milestones  
- **Trackable** – Monitored for status, progress, and completion  

## Example Scenarios

- Writing a user manual for a completed software module  
- Conducting system testing on a new application build  
- Scheduling and facilitating a stakeholder review meeting  

## Role in Project Execution

- **Builds the Schedule** – Tasks form the basis of network diagrams and Gantt charts  
- **Enables Resource Assignment** – Aligned with team members or external contributors  
- **Supports Progress Tracking** – Used in reporting tools to measure performance  
- **Connects to WBS** – Tasks roll up into work packages and control accounts
