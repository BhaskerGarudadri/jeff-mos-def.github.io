# Predictive Approach

A **Predictive Approach** is a **development approach** in which the **project scope, time, and cost are determined early** in the project life cycle. Often referred to as **waterfall**, this method relies on a structured sequence of phases with defined deliverables and low tolerance for change once planning is complete.

It is best suited for projects with **well-understood requirements**, **stable environments**, and **clearly defined outcomes**.

## Key Characteristics

- **Front-Loaded Planning** – Scope, schedule, and cost are defined up front  
- **Sequential Execution** – Phases follow a fixed order (e.g., initiation → planning → execution → closeout)  
- **Low Flexibility** – Changes require formal control procedures  
- **Heavy Documentation** – Relies on detailed plans, baselines, and approvals

## Example Scenarios

- A construction project with strict regulatory and engineering constraints  
- A government contract requiring fixed deliverables and compliance reviews  
- A manufacturing process setup with predefined steps and outcomes

## Why Predictive Approach Matters

- **Provides Clarity and Structure** – Enables detailed forecasting and control  
- **Improves Stakeholder Confidence** – Sets clear expectations early in the process  
- **Supports Compliance** – Meets needs of highly regulated or contract-driven environments  
- **Enables Performance Measurement** – Aligns with baselines for variance analysis
