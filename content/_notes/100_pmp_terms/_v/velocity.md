**Velocity** is a measure of a team’s productivity rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted within a predefined interval.

It reflects the amount of work completed during an iteration, typically measured in story points, work items, or other units defined by the team. Velocity is used to forecast future progress and assess a team’s sustainable delivery rate.

## Key Characteristics

- **Team-Specific** – Based on actual historical performance, not generalized benchmarks  
- **Iteration-Based** – Calculated at the end of each sprint or timebox  
- **Validated Work Only** – Includes only work that meets the Definition of Done  
- **Used for Forecasting** – Supports capacity planning and release projection  

## Example Scenarios

- A Scrum team completing 30 story points in Sprint 1, 32 in Sprint 2, and 31 in Sprint 3  
- Using a velocity average to forecast how many more sprints are needed to complete a release  
- Monitoring trends in velocity to assess stability and performance over time  

## Role in Agile Planning

- **Informs Sprint Planning** – Sets the baseline for what the team can commit to  
- **Improves Predictability** – Helps plan and manage stakeholder expectations  
- **Supports Continuous Improvement** – Variations may indicate bottlenecks or improvements  
- **Feeds into Burnup and Burndown Charts** – Used to visualize progress and pace
