**Validation** is the assurance that a product, service, or result meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders.

It confirms that the right product is being built by comparing outcomes to stakeholder expectations, intended use, and acceptance criteria. Validation ensures that deliverables fulfill their intended purpose in the real-world environment.

## Key Characteristics

- **Customer-Focused** – Ensures that stakeholder needs are met  
- **Performed at End of Development** – Occurs after deliverables are created or implemented  
- **Outcome-Based** – Assesses usefulness and effectiveness, not just technical accuracy  
- **Supports Formal Acceptance** – Often required before final approval or handoff  

## Example Scenarios

- Demonstrating a finished product to users during a sprint review for approval  
- Conducting user acceptance testing (UAT) before deployment  
- Presenting a completed deliverable to stakeholders for sign-off  

## Role in Quality and Delivery

- **Ensures Fitness for Use** – Confirms deliverables serve their intended purpose  
- **Reduces Rework** – Catches misalignments before product release or transition  
- **Strengthens Stakeholder Satisfaction** – Validates that business needs are being met  
- **Complements Verification** – Works alongside technical checks to ensure holistic quality
