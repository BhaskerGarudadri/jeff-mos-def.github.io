## Process: Validate Scope

**Process Group**: Monitoring and Controlling  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Scope Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Validate Scope** process involves **formally reviewing completed project deliverables with stakeholders** to confirm they meet the documented scope and are acceptable. This process results in the **formal acceptance or rejection of deliverables**, helping to ensure the project stays aligned with stakeholder expectations.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Especially the scope management plan and scope baseline (including WBS, scope statement, and WBS dictionary).
- **Project Documents** – Includes the requirements documentation and traceability matrix.
- **Verified Deliverables** – Outputs that have passed quality control inspections.
- **Work Performance Data** – Information on task status and deliverable completion.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Inspection** – The primary technique, involving reviews, audits, walkthroughs, and testing with stakeholders.
- **Decision Making** – Includes voting or other group techniques to formally approve or reject deliverables.

---

## Outputs

- **Accepted Deliverables** – Deliverables that meet the requirements and are formally approved by the customer or sponsor.
- **Work Performance Information** – Data about which deliverables have been accepted or rejected and why.
- **Change Requests** – If deliverables are rejected or incomplete, change requests may be initiated to correct them.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updates to the requirements documentation, lessons learned register, and requirements traceability matrix.

---

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- As part of the **Monitoring and Controlling Process Group**, Validate Scope provides a **formal mechanism for deliverable acceptance**.
- Within **Project Scope Management**, it ensures that deliverables meet agreed-upon requirements and that **stakeholder approval is documented**.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Confirms Stakeholder Satisfaction** – Secures formal sign-off on completed work.
- **Supports Transparency** – Makes acceptance or rejection traceable and auditable.
- **Triggers Change Control When Needed** – Rejected deliverables feed directly into corrective action and rework planning.
- **Prevents Future Disputes** – Establishes an official record of deliverable acceptance.
