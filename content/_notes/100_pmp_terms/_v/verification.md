**Verification** is the evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or result complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition.

It ensures that the work has been correctly executed according to predefined standards or criteria. Verification is typically a technical process conducted through inspection, testing, analysis, or demonstration to confirm that outputs are built correctly.

## Key Characteristics

- **Standards-Based** – Confirms compliance with technical and contractual requirements  
- **Process-Oriented** – Focuses on building the product right  
- **Performed Internally** – Usually conducted by the development or quality team  
- **Supports Deliverable Readiness** – Validates that outputs are complete and conforming  

## Example Scenarios

- Conducting unit tests to confirm code functions as expected  
- Verifying that a report matches the approved format and contains required data  
- Inspecting a deliverable for compliance with design specifications  

## Role in Quality Control

- **Ensures Specification Compliance** – Confirms that outputs match agreed requirements  
- **Reduces Defects** – Identifies errors early in the development lifecycle  
- **Complements Validation** – Paired with validation to ensure quality and fitness for use  
- **Strengthens Governance** – Provides traceable evidence of conformance
