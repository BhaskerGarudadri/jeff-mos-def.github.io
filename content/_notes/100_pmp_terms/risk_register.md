A **Risk Register** is a repository in which outputs of risk management processes are recorded.

It documents identified risks, their characteristics, assigned owners, response strategies, and monitoring plans, serving as the central reference for managing and tracking risk throughout the project or program.

## Key Characteristics

- **Supports Decision-Making** – Informs planning, prioritization, and resource allocation  
- **Includes Response Details** – Captures selected strategies and associated actions  

## Example Scenarios

- Logging new risks identified during execution along with mitigation plans  
- Tracking risk status and changes in exposure throughout the project lifecycle  
- Documenting residual risks and contingency triggers after implementing responses
