**Discrete Effort** is an **activity that can be planned, measured, and tracked**, yielding a **specific, tangible output**. It is commonly used in **Earned Value Management (EVM)** to assess project progress.

## **Key Aspects of Discrete Effort**
- **Planned & Measurable** – Has defined start and completion criteria.
- **Produces a Specific Output** – Results in a verifiable deliverable.
- **Tracked for Performance Measurement** – Can be assessed using Earned Value techniques.
- **Different from Apportioned & Level of Effort** – Unlike these, discrete effort results in a concrete outcome.

## **Comparison with Other Effort Types**
| **Effort Type**       | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Discrete Effort** | Planned and results in a tangible deliverable. | Developing a software feature. |
| **Apportioned Effort** | Proportional to another effort; cannot be separated. | Quality control based on work completed. |
| **Level of Effort (LOE)** | Ongoing support tasks with no discrete deliverable. | Project management or maintenance work. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development**
A development team working on **building a login system** follows **discrete effort**, as it has a **defined scope, timeline, and measurable completion criteria**.

### **Construction Project**
Laying the **foundation of a building** is a discrete effort since it **has a planned duration and a clearly defined output**.

### **Marketing Campaign**
Creating **a promotional video** is a discrete effort, as it **involves specific tasks and results in a final product**.

## **Why Discrete Effort Matters**
- **Improves Project Tracking** – Helps measure performance accurately.
- **Supports Earned Value Management (EVM)** – Enables precise cost and schedule assessments.
- **Ensures Clear Deliverables** – Defines outputs for accountability.
- **Enhances Resource Planning** – Allocates work effectively.
