# Pessimistic Duration

**Pessimistic Duration** is an estimate of the **longest possible time** required to complete an activity, taking into account **all known variables that could negatively affect performance**. It represents the **worst-case scenario** and is a critical component of three-point estimating methods such as PERT.

This estimate helps teams plan for delays and build appropriate buffers into schedules.

## Characteristics of Pessimistic Duration

- **Worst-Case Estimate** – Reflects maximum time based on known risks and delays  
- **Used in Forecasting** – Essential in calculating expected durations  
- **Data-Informed** – Based on historical problems, complexity, or external constraints  
- **Scenario-Based** – Informed by risk identification and mitigation planning  

## Example Scenarios

- A procurement task that usually takes 10 days could extend to 25 due to supplier issues  
- Testing may require 15 days if multiple bugs are discovered  
- Review cycles might stretch to 12 days due to stakeholder availability

## Expected Duration Formula (PERT)

$$
E = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6}
$$

Why Pessimistic Duration Matters

- Highlights Risk Impact – Exposes schedule threats before they occur
- Improves Forecast Accuracy – Helps refine expectations in high-uncertainty tasks
- Supports Contingency Planning – Guides buffer allocation for high-risk activities
- Enables Realistic Scheduling – Avoids underestimating time on critical tasks
