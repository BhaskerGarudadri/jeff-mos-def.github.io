A **Resource Optimization Technique** is a technique in which activity start and finish dates are adjusted to balance demand for resources with the available supply.

It ensures that resource usage remains within availability constraints by modifying the project schedule, using approaches such as resource leveling and resource smoothing.

## Key Characteristics

- **Schedule Adjustment** – Alters task timing to fit resource limitations  
- **Capacity-Conscious** – Aims to prevent overallocation and underutilization  
- **Includes Multiple Methods** – Commonly applies resource leveling and smoothing  
- **Maintains Feasibility** – Aligns schedule feasibility with actual resource availability  

## Example Scenarios

- Extending the timeline of overlapping tasks to reduce resource conflicts  
- Modifying activity sequences to avoid overburdening a specific team  
- Delaying non-critical activities without affecting project milestones  

## Comparison of Resource Optimization Techniques

| Technique           | Impacts Critical Path? | Used When Resource Limits Are Exceeded? | May Delay Project Completion? | Focus                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Resource Leveling   | Yes                    | Yes                                      | Yes                           | Balancing demand with availability      |
| Resource Smoothing  | No                     | No                                       | No                            | Optimizing within float without delays  |

## Role in Project Planning and Control

- **Improves Resource Efficiency** – Optimizes how and when resources are used  
- **Supports Realistic Scheduling** – Produces achievable timelines under real-world constraints  
- **Reduces Project Risk** – Mitigates schedule disruption caused by resource limitations  
- **Aligns with Other Plans** – Works in coordination with the resource management plan and schedule baseline
