# Output

An **Output** is a **product, result, or service** generated by a process. It is the **tangible or intangible deliverable** produced as a direct result of executing project activities and is often used as an **input for a subsequent process** or phase.

Outputs serve as milestones or checkpoints in the progression toward achieving broader outcomes and objectives.

## Characteristics of an Output

- **Process-Driven** – Created as a result of executing planned activities  
- **Transferable** – Often used as input for another process or team  
- **Measurable** – Can be verified and validated for quality and completeness  
- **Aligned with Scope** – Tied directly to project requirements

## Example Scenarios

- A completed wireframe design for a website  
- A status report delivered to stakeholders  
- A manufactured component ready for integration  
- A validated dataset passed to analytics for modeling

## Why Outputs Matter

- **Mark Progress** – Indicate completion of specific project phases  
- **Enable Next Steps** – Serve as inputs for downstream activities  
- **Support Quality Assurance** – Allow for inspection and validation  
- **Drive Outcome Realization** – Serve as the building blocks for delivering value
