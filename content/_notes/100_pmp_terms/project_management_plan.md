The **Project Management Plan** is the **document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed**. It serves as the central reference for all project operations, integrating and consolidating all subsidiary plans into a coordinated and actionable blueprint for delivery.

This plan defines how scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communication, and risks will be managed, ensuring consistency, accountability, and alignment with organizational objectives.

## Key Characteristics

- **Integrated Framework** – Unifies all subsidiary plans into a single management baseline  
- **Lifecycle-Spanning** – Guides the project from initiation through closeout  
- **Governance-Driven** – Establishes controls, escalation paths, and performance thresholds  
- **Living Document** – Updated as the project evolves or changes are approved

- **Scope Management Plan** – Defines how the scope will be defined, validated, and controlled  
- **Schedule Management Plan** – Establishes timing, milestones, and scheduling tools

## Example Scenarios

- **Aligns Teams and Stakeholders** – Establishes a common understanding of goals and approaches  
- **Enables Control and Oversight** – Provides the baseline for tracking and managing performance
