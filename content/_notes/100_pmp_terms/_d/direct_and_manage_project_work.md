## Process: Direct and Manage Project Work

**Process Group**: Executing  
**Knowledge Area**: Project Integration Management  

---

## Purpose

The **Direct and Manage Project Work** process involves **leading and performing the work** defined in the project management plan and **implementing approved changes** to achieve project objectives. It includes managing deliverables, using resources, and ensuring that tasks are executed according to plan in real time.

---

## Inputs

- **Project Management Plan** – Contains all baseline and subsidiary plans needed to guide execution.
- **Project Documents** – Includes change logs, lessons learned, risk register, and requirements documentation.
- **Approved Change Requests** – Modifications that have passed through the integrated change control process.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Organizational culture, standards, and systems that influence execution.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Templates, procedures, and historical information used to support execution.

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Applied to interpret plans, make decisions, and solve execution challenges.
- **Project Management Information System (PMIS)** – Systems used to track progress, manage data, and facilitate communication.
- **Meetings** – Used to coordinate actions, resolve issues, and engage stakeholders during execution.

## Outputs

- **Deliverables** – The completed outputs of project work ready for validation.
- **Work Performance Data** – Raw data on activities performed, such as start/finish dates, status, and costs.
- **Issue Log** – A record of issues identified, assigned, tracked, and resolved.
- **Change Requests** – New requests generated during execution to modify scope, schedule, cost, etc.
- **Project Management Plan Updates** – Adjustments made as needed to reflect reality and maintain alignment.
- **Project Document Updates** – Updated documents such as risk register, stakeholder register, and lessons learned.

## Role in the Process Group and Knowledge Area

- In the **Executing Process Group**, this is the central process where **work is actually performed**.
- Within **Project Integration Management**, it reflects the active coordination and management of all project elements as defined during planning.

## Why It Matters

- **Drives Progress** – It’s where the bulk of the project work happens, converting plans into results.
- **Ensures Alignment** – Keeps execution tied to the plan, adjusting when necessary through change requests.
- **Supports Real-Time Decision Making** – Allows the team to react to conditions on the ground while still tracking toward objectives.
- **Feeds Monitoring and Control** – Provides the data needed to assess performance and identify corrective actions.
