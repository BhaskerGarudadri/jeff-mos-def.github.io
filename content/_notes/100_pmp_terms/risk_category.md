A **Risk Category** is a group of potential causes of risk.

It provides a structured way to classify risks based on their source or nature, enabling more effective identification, organization, and analysis of risks across the project or program.

## Key Characteristics

- **Source-Based Grouping** – Organizes risks by common origin or type  
- **Enhances Clarity** – Supports targeted analysis and planning  
- **Facilitates Completeness** – Ensures a broad range of risks is considered  
- **Feeds Into Breakdown Structures** – Forms the basis of a risk breakdown structure  

## Example Scenarios

- Grouping risks as technical, financial, or external during planning  
- Using risk categories to assign ownership by functional expertise  
- Categorizing new risks as they are added to the risk register  

## Examples of Risk Categories

## Example Risk Categories

| Category              | Description                                                             | Example Risks                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical             | Related to technology, systems, and specifications                      | Design errors, integration failures, software bugs              |
| External              | Originating outside the project or organization                         | Regulatory changes, market shifts, weather events               |
| Organizational        | Internal to the performing organization                                 | Resource shortages, restructuring, skill gaps                   |
| Project Management    | Arising from planning and control processes                             | Schedule compression, scope creep, cost estimation errors       |
| Commercial/Procurement| Involving contracts, vendors, and external suppliers                    | Supplier delays, contract disputes, cost escalation             |
| Legal/Compliance      | Pertaining to laws, standards, and regulatory obligations                | Data privacy violations, licensing issues, audit non-compliance |
| Strategic             | Affecting alignment with business objectives or enterprise priorities   | Shifts in leadership vision, portfolio reprioritization         |


## Role in Risk Identification and Planning

- **Improves Risk Organization** – Structures how risks are captured and tracked  
- **Supports Prioritization** – Enables risk scoring and response by category  
- **Enables Tailored Responses** – Allows strategies to align with specific risk types  
- **Strengthens Documentation** – Enhances reporting and stakeholder communication
