The **Cost Baseline** is the **approved version of the time-phased project budget**, excluding **management reserves**, that can only be changed through **formal change control procedures**. It serves as the **reference point for measuring actual project costs**.

## Key Aspects of Cost Baseline
- **Time-Phased Budget** – Allocates planned expenditures over the project timeline.
- **Used for Performance Tracking** – Enables comparison of actual costs to planned expenditures.
- **Excludes Management Reserves** – Only includes planned costs, not unallocated contingency funds.
- **Requires Change Control for Modifications** – Any changes must be formally approved.

## Cost Baseline in Earned Value Management (EVM)
| **Metric**             | **Description** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Planned Value (PV)** | Budgeted cost for work scheduled at a given point in time. |
| **Actual Cost (AC)**   | Total cost incurred for completed work. |
| **Earned Value (EV)**  | Budgeted cost of the work actually performed. |
| **Cost Variance (CV)** | EV - AC; Measures cost performance relative to budget. |

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A software company creates a **cost baseline** that includes **planned costs for development, testing, and deployment**, phased over six months.

### **Construction Project**
A **building project** defines a **cost baseline** covering **labor, materials, and equipment costs**, ensuring that expenses align with forecasts.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A global brand establishes a **cost baseline** for its **advertising budget**, allowing financial tracking against actual campaign expenses.

## Why Cost Baselines Matter
- **Ensure Financial Control** – Helps manage project spending effectively.
- **Improve Cost Forecasting** – Provides a structured reference for budgeting.
- **Support Earned Value Analysis** – Enables accurate cost performance measurement.
- **Enhance Stakeholder Confidence** – Demonstrates financial planning and accountability.
