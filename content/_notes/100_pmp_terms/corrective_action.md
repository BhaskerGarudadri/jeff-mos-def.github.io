A **Corrective Action** is an **intentional activity** taken to **realign project performance** with the **Project Management Plan**. It is implemented when deviations from the plan occur and are identified through **performance monitoring and control processes**.

## Key Aspects of Corrective Action
- **Addresses Performance Deviations** – Used when actual results do not align with planned objectives.
- **Requires Root Cause Analysis** – Identifies the source of the issue before implementing fixes.
- **Ensures Project Realignment** – Helps bring scope, schedule, cost, or quality back on track.
- **Can Involve Process or Resource Adjustments** – May include reallocation of resources, schedule modifications, or workflow changes.

## Corrective Action vs. Preventive Action
| **Action Type**       | **Description** | **Example** |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Corrective Action** | Fixes an existing deviation from the plan. | Adjusting the project schedule after a delay in deliverables. |
| **Preventive Action** | Proactively prevents potential issues before they occur. | Adding extra testing phases to avoid defects in production. |

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A project falls behind schedule due to **delayed testing cycles**, prompting a **corrective action** to **increase tester resources and adjust work priorities**.

### **Construction Project**
Material supply issues cause **unexpected delays**, leading to a **corrective action** that **secures an alternative supplier and reschedules affected tasks**.

### **Business Operations**
Customer support response times exceed targets, triggering a **corrective action** that **introduces automation and additional staffing to improve service levels**.

## Why Corrective Actions Matter
- **Improve Project Performance** – Ensures that work realigns with planned objectives.
- **Reduce the Impact of Delays or Cost Overruns** – Helps contain issues before they escalate.
- **Enhance Stakeholder Confidence** – Demonstrates proactive issue management.
- **Supports Continuous Improvement** – Enables teams to learn from past mistakes and refine processes.
