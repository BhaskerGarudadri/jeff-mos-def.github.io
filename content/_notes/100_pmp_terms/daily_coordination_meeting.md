A **Daily Coordination Meeting** is a **brief, daily collaboration session** where the team **reviews progress from the previous day, declares intentions for the current day, and highlights obstacles** that could impact workflow. Previously known as a **standup meeting**, this practice is commonly used in **Agile, Scrum, and Lean** environments.

## **Key Aspects of a Daily Coordination Meeting**
- **Time-Boxed (Typically 15 Minutes or Less)** – Keeps the meeting focused and efficient.
- **Team-Centric & Collaborative** – Ensures all members are aligned on goals.
- **Obstacle Identification** – Helps surface impediments for quick resolution.
- **Encourages Transparency & Accountability** – Each team member shares updates openly.

## **Typical Agenda (Three Key Questions)**
1. **What did you accomplish yesterday?**
2. **What will you work on today?**
3. **Are there any blockers preventing progress?**

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Software Development (Scrum)**
A development team holds a **daily coordination meeting** to discuss **completed features, in-progress work, and roadblocks like unresolved bugs**.

### **Construction Project**
A project team gathers **each morning** to review **task progress, safety concerns, and supply chain delays**.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A cross-functional marketing team meets daily to **align on content schedules, ad performance, and campaign adjustments**.
