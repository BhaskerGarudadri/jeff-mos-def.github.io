# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** are a goal-setting framework used to define and track objectives and their measurable outcomes. An OKR consists of a **clear objective**—what you want to achieve—and a set of **key results**—specific, time-bound, and measurable indicators of success.

OKRs are commonly used in business environments to ensure alignment across individuals, teams, and the organization as a whole. They promote focus, transparency, and accountability by establishing what matters most and tracking progress toward those goals.

## Structure of OKRs

- **Objective** — A qualitative statement that defines what you want to accomplish  
- **Key Results** — Quantitative measures that indicate how you will know the objective has been met

## Example

**Objective:** Improve customer satisfaction with product support  
**Key Results:**  
- Increase average CSAT score from 78% to 90%  
- Reduce first-response time to under 2 hours  
- Resolve 80% of support tickets within 24 hours  

## Why OKRs Matter

- Encourage ambitious goal-setting and outcome-driven focus  
- Create alignment across teams and departments  
- Track progress and adapt efforts based on measurable data  
- Foster ownership and clarity in execution
