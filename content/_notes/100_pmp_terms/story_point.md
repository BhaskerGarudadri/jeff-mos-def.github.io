A **Story Point** is a unit used to estimate the relative level of effort needed to implement a user story.

It represents a combination of complexity, risk, and the amount of work involved, rather than a fixed duration of time. Story points enable teams to forecast velocity, compare tasks, and plan iteratively in an abstract, consistent manner.

## Key Characteristics

- **Relative Measure** – Based on comparisons with other stories, not absolute time  
- **Team-Specific** – Calibrated according to the team's understanding and historical performance  
- **Includes Complexity and Risk** – Factors in uncertainty and difficulty, not just effort  
- **Supports Velocity Tracking** – Aggregated into completed points per sprint for planning  

## Example Scenarios

- Assigning a 1-point story for a simple UI update  
- Labeling a complex integration story as 8 points due to unknowns and dependencies  
- Refining estimates during backlog grooming using Planning Poker  

## Role in Agile Estimation and Delivery

- **Improves Predictability** – Enables stable sprint planning over time  
- **Avoids Time-Based Bias** – Focuses on scope and difficulty, not duration  
- **Promotes Collaboration** – Encourages team discussion and consensus around effort  
- **Feeds Release Forecasting** – Used to predict delivery timelines based on velocity
