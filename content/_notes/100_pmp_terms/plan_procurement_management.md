- **Project Documents** – Includes risk register, requirements documentation, stakeholder register, and resource requirements.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** – Market conditions, legal restrictions, supplier availability, and local practices.
- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** – Procurement templates, standard contract types, and lessons learned from past procurements.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment** – Used to develop procurement strategies, evaluate market options, and select contract types.
