title: Jeff's PMP Study Notes
---

Welcome! My name is Jeff, and I’m currently studying for the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** certification. I’m a **SAFe 6 SPC** and have worked as a **Technical Program Manager** in roles supporting the **U.S. Air Force**. This site is built with **Quartz** and hosted on **GitHub Pages** to serve as a knowledge base for my PMP studies.

I'm using this space to study in public—documenting **PMP process groups, knowledge areas, and key project management concepts**. By structuring my notes here, I can reinforce my own learning while making the material available to others preparing for the PMP exam.

Since Quartz makes it easy to map knowledge and connect related topics, you can explore different concepts through links and structured notes. I’ll continue updating the site with more content as I progress. If you’re on the same journey, I hope this helps!
