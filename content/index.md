title: Jeff's PMP Study Notes
---

Welcome! My name is Jeff, and I’m currently studying for the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** certification. I’m a **SAFe 6 SPC** and have worked as a **Technical Program Manager** in roles supporting the **U.S. Air Force**.  

This site is built with **Quartz**, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and written in **Markdown** to organize my PMP study materials in a structured, linked format. By studying in public, I’m reinforcing my learning while making these resources available for others preparing for the PMP exam.  

You'll find notes on **PMP process groups, knowledge areas, and key project management concepts**, mapped together for easy reference. Since Quartz allows for knowledge linking, you can explore related topics as you navigate the content.  

I'll keep updating the site as I progress. Hope this helps!
