title: Jeff's PMP Study Notes
date: 3-19-2025
---

Welcome! My name is Jeff, and I’m currently studying for the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** certification. I’m a **SAFe 6 SPC** and have worked as a **Technical Program Manager** in roles supporting the **U.S. Air Force**.  

This site is built with **Quartz**, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and written in **Markdown** to organize my PMP study materials in a structured, linked format. By studying in public, I’m reinforcing my learning while making these resources available for others preparing for the PMP exam.  

You'll find notes on **PMP process groups, knowledge areas, and key project management concepts**, mapped together for easy reference. Since Quartz allows for knowledge linking, you can explore related topics as you navigate the content.  

I'll keep updating the site as I progress. Hope this helps!

19Mar25 Update:

I've gotten through the L's of my defnitions, and have also started to, on text, make the associations to other terms. Those will be linked in the future.

I've also added some resources I've used and will continue to do so.

26Mar25 Update:

Continued inject of relevant terms with minimal linking. 

I've also started to map out the <a href="https://jeff-mos-def.github.io/_notes/200_process_groups/process_groups_and_knowledge_areas">process groups and knowledge areas</a>.

---

30Mar25 Update:

Process groups and knowledge areas have been created and linked. It's possible that I may link some more items in there in the future.

Added <a href="https://giscus.app/">Giscus</a> as a communication hub.

Added *Recent Notes* to show what has been updated lately.

Removed redundant tags I had set up in my template (project-management, pmp) to focus on real tags.

Added a <a href="https://github.com/jeff-mos-def/jeff-mos-def.github.io/issues/new?labels=bug&template=content_bug.md">Bug or Correction Report</a> link to allow for reporting of content that is in need of correction or further development.

This section will eventually be moved to an update page and a proper landing page will be created. At this point, this is just knowledge capture.
