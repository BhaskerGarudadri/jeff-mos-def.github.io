David McLachlan’s video provides a detailed walkthrough of PMP situational questions, focusing on how to apply project management principles in real-world scenarios. These types of questions test decision-making, leadership, and problem-solving skills—key areas that separate memorization from true project management expertise.  

A major focus is stakeholder engagement. Situational questions often present conflicting priorities, requiring project managers to assess stakeholder influence, balance expectations, and adjust communication strategies effectively. Recognizing how to manage stakeholder relationships under pressure is critical.  

Risk management is another core area. The exam frequently tests how project managers handle unforeseen risks—whether by implementing contingency plans, escalating to leadership, or applying mitigation strategies. Understanding the risk response hierarchy is essential for answering these questions correctly.  

Change management scenarios challenge candidates to determine the best response when scope modifications, process improvements, or unexpected shifts occur. The ability to follow structured change control procedures while maintaining flexibility is a key exam skill.  

Team leadership and conflict resolution are also highlighted. The video reinforces the importance of applying servant leadership principles, fostering collaboration, and choosing the right approach for team motivation and issue resolution.  

McLachlan references the **PMBOK Guide 7th Edition** and the **Process Groups Practice Guide**, emphasizing the need for a strong grasp of these frameworks. Practicing with realistic exam scenarios like the ones covered in the video is essential for mastering situational PMP questions.
