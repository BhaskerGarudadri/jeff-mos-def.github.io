David McLachlan’s recent video walks viewers through 10 predictive-style PMP and CAPM practice questions, offering targeted exam prep for those focusing on traditional project management methods. The questions span foundational topics like scope development, change management, earned value metrics, and schedule analysis.

The session opens with a scenario requiring the choice of a predictive lifecycle for a clear, repeatable project—highlighting the alignment between detailed upfront planning and project clarity. Subsequent questions tackle change requests, stressing the proper order of operations following Change Control Board decisions, including documentation and stakeholder notification.

Scope-related questions reinforce the importance of developing a detailed project scope statement before decomposing work into a Work Breakdown Structure. One scenario tests the appropriate use of management reserves when dealing with unexpected scope changes that remain within the authorized budget.

Earned Value Analysis gets practical attention through exercises on interpreting Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Variance (SV), helping candidates connect performance data to corrective actions. These metrics are essential for monitoring cost efficiency and schedule adherence in predictive environments.

The critical path method features in a question focused on schedule compression strategies, such as fast tracking and float usage, where the goal is to maintain the timeline without additional spending.

McLachlan points learners to the Process Groups Practice Guide and the PMBOK® Guide 7th Edition for further reading. This installment is a focused resource for brushing up on core predictive concepts ahead of the PMP or CAPM exam.
