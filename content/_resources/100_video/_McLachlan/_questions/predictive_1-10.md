David McLachlan’s latest video provides a walkthrough of 10 predictive PMP and CAPM practice questions, reinforcing essential project management principles. The questions cover critical topics like scope management, change control, and earned value analysis—core areas for the exam.  

The video begins with selecting a predictive approach for a well-defined construction project, emphasizing how prior experience informs planning decisions. Change management follows, outlining the correct sequence after a Change Control Board approval—ensuring updates to the change log and clear communication.  

Scope management is another focal point, covering the logical progression from defining the project scope statement to structuring a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Handling scope changes within budget constraints is also discussed, introducing management reserves as a tool for unforeseen adjustments.  

Earned Value Analysis (EVA) plays a significant role in exam preparation, with questions on Schedule Variance (SV) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) to determine schedule and budget health. Understanding these metrics ensures project managers can accurately assess performance and take corrective action.  

The critical path method is another key topic, with an emphasis on identifying the longest sequence of dependent tasks to determine project duration. The final question explores strategies for keeping a project on track without additional budget, focusing on leveraging project float and fast tracking.  

McLachlan references the **Process Groups Practice Guide** and **PMBOK Guide 7th Edition** for further study, reinforcing the need for a strong grasp of predictive methodologies. This video serves as a valuable resource for those looking to refine their approach to PMP and CAPM exam questions.
